Another book with old Icelandic myths and sagas, but this time all in English, so if proofing the old-Icelandic in <i>Origines Islandicae</i> is too much for you, this English translation gives you an easier alternative.


<p>Please note the special characters used to indicate pronunciation in the index, such as macrons and over dots. Examples:

<p>a with over dot [.a]

<p>o with macron [=o]

<p>double o with macron (over both) [=oo]

<p>e with tilde [~e]
