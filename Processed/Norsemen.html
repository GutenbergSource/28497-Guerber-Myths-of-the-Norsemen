extraordinary indifference to the wealth of religious tradition and mythical lore
which they contain.
</p>
<p>The long neglect of these precious records of our heathen ancestors is not the fault
of the material in which all that survives of their religious beliefs is enshrined,
for it may safely be asserted that the Edda is as rich in the essentials of national
romance and race-imagination, rugged though it be, as the more graceful and idyllic
mythology of the South. Neither is it due to anything weak in the conception of the
deities themselves, for although they may not rise to great spiritual heights, foremost
students of Icelandic literature agree that they stand out rude and massive as the
Scandinavian mountains. They exhibit “a spirit of victory, superior to brute force,
superior to mere matter, a spirit that fights and overcomes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1055src" href="#xd32e1055">1</a> “Even were some part of the matter of their myths taken from others, yet the Norsemen
have given their gods a noble, upright, great spirit, and placed them upon a high
level that is all their own.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1058src" href="#xd32e1058">2</a> “In fact these old Norse songs have a truth in them, an inward perennial truth and
greatness. <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1061">[<a href="#xd32e1061">xii</a>]</span>It is a greatness not of mere body and gigantic bulk, but a rude greatness of soul.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1063src" href="#xd32e1063">3</a>
</p>
<p>The introduction of Christianity into the North brought with it the influence of the
Classical races, and this eventually supplanted the native genius, so that the alien
mythology and literature of Greece and Rome have formed an increasing part of the
mental equipment of the northern peoples in proportion as the native literature and
tradition have been neglected.
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Northern mythology has exercised a deep influence upon our customs, laws,
and language, and there has been, therefore, a great unconscious inspiration flowing
from these into English literature. The most distinctive traits of this mythology
are a peculiar grim humour, to be found in the religion of no other race, and a dark
thread of tragedy which runs throughout the whole woof, and these characteristics,
touching both extremes, are writ large over English literature.
</p>
<p>But of conscious influence, compared with the rich draught of Hellenic inspiration,
there is little to be found, and if we turn to modern art the difference is even more
apparent.
</p>
<p>This indifference may be attributed to many causes, but it was due first to the fact
that the religious beliefs of our pagan ancestors were not held with any real tenacity.
Hence the success of the more or less considered policy of the early Christian missionaries
to confuse the heathen beliefs, and merge them in the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1071">[<a href="#xd32e1071">xiii</a>]</span>new faith, an interesting example of which is to be seen in the transference to the
Christian festival of Easter of the attributes of the pagan goddess Eástre, from whom
it took even the name. Northern mythology was in this way arrested ere it had attained
its full development, and the progress of Christianity eventually relegated it to
the limbo of forgotten things. Its comprehensive and intelligent scheme, however,
in strong contrast with the disconnected mythology of Greece and Rome, formed the
basis of a more or less rational faith which prepared the Norseman to receive the
teaching of Christianity, and so helped to bring about its own undoing.
</p>
<p>The religious beliefs of the North are not mirrored with any exactitude in the Elder
Edda. Indeed only a travesty of the faith of our ancestors has been preserved in Norse
literature. The early poet loved allegory, and his imagination rioted among the conceptions
of his fertile muse. “His eye was fixed on the mountains till the snowy peaks assumed
human features and the giant of the rock or the ice descended with heavy tread; or
he would gaze at the splendour of the spring, or of the summer fields, till Freya
with the gleaming necklace stepped forth, or Sif with the flowing locks of gold.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1075src" href="#xd32e1075">4</a>
</p>
<p>We are told nothing as to sacrificial and religious rites, and all else is omitted
which does not provide material for artistic treatment. The so-called Northern Mythology,
therefore, may be regarded as <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1080">[<a href="#xd32e1080">xiv</a>]</span>a precious relic of the beginning of Northern poetry, rather than as a representation
of the religious beliefs of the Scandinavians, and these literary fragments bear many
signs of the transitional stage wherein the confusion of the old and new faiths is
easily apparent.
</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the limitations imposed by long neglect it is possible to reconstruct
in part a plan of the ancient Norse beliefs, and the general reader will derive much
profit from Carlyle’s illuminating study in “Heroes and Hero-worship.” “A bewildering,
inextricable jungle of delusions, confusions, falsehoods and absurdities, covering
the whole field of Life!” he calls them, with all good reason. But he goes on to show,
with equal truth, that at the soul of this crude worship of distorted nature was a
spiritual force seeking expression. What we probe without reverence they viewed with
awe, and not understanding it, straightway deified it, as all children have been apt
to do in all stages of the world’s history. Truly they were hero-worshippers after
Carlyle’s own heart, and scepticism had no place in their simple philosophy.
</p>
<p>It was the infancy of thought gazing upon a universe filled with divinity, and believing
heartily with all sincerity. A large-hearted people reaching out in the dark towards
ideals which were better than they knew. Ragnarok was to undo their gods because they
had stumbled from their higher standards.
</p>
<p>We have to thank a curious phenomenon for the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1087">[<a href="#xd32e1087">xv</a>]</span>preservation of so much of the old lore as we still possess. While foreign influences
were corrupting the Norse language, it remained practically unaltered in Iceland,
which had been colonised from the mainland by the Norsemen who had fled thither to
escape the oppression of Harold Fairhair after his crushing victory of Hafrsfirth.
These people brought with them the poetic genius which had already manifested itself,
and it took fresh root in that barren soil. Many of the old Norse poets were natives
of Iceland, and in the early part of the Christian era, a supreme service was rendered
to Norse literature by the Christian priest, Sæmund, who industriously brought together
a large amount of pagan poetry in a collection known as the Elder Edda, which is the
chief foundation of our present knowledge of the religion of our Norse ancestors.
Icelandic literature remained a sealed book, however, until the end of the eighteenth
century, and very slowly since that time it has been winning its way in the teeth
of indifference, until there are now signs that it will eventually come into its own.
“To know the old Faith,” says Carlyle, “brings us into closer and clearer relation
with the Past—with our own possessions in the Past. For the whole Past is the possession
of the Present; the Past had always something true, and is a precious possession.”
</p>
<p>The weighty words of William Morris regarding the Volsunga Saga may also be fitly
quoted as an introduction to the whole of this collection of “Myths of <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1091">[<a href="#xd32e1091">xvi</a>]</span>the Norsemen”: “This is the great story of the North, which should be to all our race
what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks—to all our race first, and afterwards, when
the change of the world has made our race nothing more than a name of what has been—a
story too—then should it be to those that come after us no less than the Tale of Troy
has been to us.”

<h3 class="main">Myths of Creation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the Aryan inhabitants of Northern Europe are supposed by some authorities
to have come originally from the plateau of Iran, in the heart of Asia, the climate
and scenery of the countries where they finally settled had great influence in shaping
their early religious beliefs, as well as in ordering their mode of living.
</p>
<p>The grand and rugged landscapes of Northern Europe, the midnight sun, the flashing
rays of the aurora borealis, the ocean continually lashing itself into fury against
the great cliffs and icebergs of the Arctic Circle, could not but impress the people
as vividly as the almost miraculous vegetation, the perpetual light, and the blue
seas and skies of their brief summer season. It is no great wonder, therefore, that
the Icelanders, for instance, to whom we owe the most perfect records of this belief,
fancied in looking about them that the world was originally created from a strange
mixture of fire and ice.
</p>
<p>Northern mythology is grand and tragical. Its principal theme is the perpetual struggle
of the beneficent forces of Nature against the injurious, and hence it is not graceful
and idyllic in character, like the religion of the sunny South, where the people could
bask in perpetual sunshine, and the fruits of the earth grew ready to their hand.
</p>
<p>It was very natural that the dangers incurred in hunting and fishing under these inclement
skies, and the suffering entailed by the long cold winters when the sun never shines,
made our ancestors contemplate cold and ice as malevolent spirits; and it was with
equal reason that they invoked with special fervour the beneficent influences of heat
and light.

<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>When questioned concerning the creation of the world, the Northern scalds, or poets,
whose songs are preserved in the Eddas and Sagas, declared that in the beginning,
when there was as yet no earth, nor sea, nor air, when darkness rested over all, there
existed a powerful being called Allfather, whom they dimly conceived as uncreated
as well as unseen, and that whatever he willed came to pass.
</p>
<p>In the centre of space there was, in the morning of time, a great abyss called Ginnunga-gap,
the cleft of clefts, the yawning gulf, whose depths no eye could fathom, as it was
enveloped in perpetual twilight. North of this abode was a space or world known as
Nifl-heim, the home of mist and darkness, in the centre of which bubbled the exhaustless
spring Hvergelmir, the seething cauldron, whose waters supplied twelve great streams
known as the Elivagar. As the water of these streams flowed swiftly away from its
source and encountered the cold blasts from the yawning gulf, it soon hardened into
huge blocks of ice, which rolled downward into the immeasurable depths of the great
abyss with a continual roar like thunder.
</p>
<p>South of this dark chasm, and directly opposite Nifl-heim, the realm of mist, was
another world called Muspells-heim, the home of elemental fire, where all was warmth
and brightness, and whose frontiers were continually guarded by Surtr, the flame giant.
This giant fiercely brandished his flashing sword, and continually sent forth great
showers of sparks, which fell with a hissing sound upon the ice-blocks in the bottom
of the abyss, and partly melted them by their heat.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the steam rose in clouds it again encountered the prevailing cold, and was changed
into rime or hoarfrost, which, layer by layer, filled up the great central space.
Thus by the continual action of cold and heat, and also probably by the will of the
uncreated and unseen, a gigantic creature called Ymir or Orgelmir (seething clay),
the personification of the frozen ocean, came to life amid the ice-blocks in the abyss,
and as he was born of rime he was called a Hrim-thurs, or ice-giant.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In early times,
</p>
<p class="line">When Ymir lived,
</p>
<p class="line">Was sand, nor sea,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sæmund’s Edda (Henderson’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Groping about in the gloom in search of something to eat, Ymir perceived a gigantic
cow called Audhumla (the nourisher), which had been created by the same agency as
himself, and out of the same materials. Hastening towards her, Ymir noticed with pleasure
that from her udder flowed four great streams of milk, which would supply ample nourishment.
</p>
<p>All his wants were thus satisfied; but the cow, looking about her for food in her
turn, began to lick the salt off a neighbouring ice-block with her rough tongue. This
she continued to do until first the hair of a god appeared and then the whole head
emerged from its icy envelope, until by-and-by Buri (the producer) stepped forth entirely
free.
</p>
<p>While the cow had been thus engaged, Ymir, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>giant, had fallen asleep, and as he slept a son and daughter were born from the perspiration
under his armpit, and his feet produced the six-headed giant Thrudgelmir, who, shortly

evil frost giants are descended.

<p class="first">When these giants became aware of the existence of the god Buri, and of his son Börr
(born), whom he had immediately produced, they began waging war against them, for
as the gods and giants represented the opposite forces of good and evil, there was
no hope of their living together in peace. The struggle continued evidently for ages,
neither party gaining a decided advantage, until Börr married the giantess Bestla,
daughter of Bolthorn (the thorn of evil), who bore him three powerful sons, Odin (spirit),
Vili (will), and Ve (holy). These three sons immediately joined their father in his
struggle against the hostile frost-giants, and finally succeeded in slaying their
deadliest foe, the great Ymir. As he sank down lifeless the blood gushed from his
wounds in such floods that it produced a great deluge, in which all his race perished,
with the exception of Bergelmir, who escaped in a boat and went with his wife to the
confines of the world.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,

<p>Here he took up his abode, calling the place Jötunheim (the home of the giants), and
here he begat a new race of frost-giants, who inherited his dislikes, continued the
feud, and were always ready to sally forth from their desolate country and raid the
territory of the gods.
</p>
<p>The gods, in Northern mythology called Æsir (pillars and supporters of the world),
having thus triumphed over their foes, and being no longer engaged in perpetual warfare,
now began to look about them, with intent to improve the desolate aspect of things
and fashion a habitable world. After due consideration Börr’s sons rolled Ymir’s great
corpse into the yawning abyss, and began to create the world out of its various component
parts.

This was placed in the exact centre of the vast space, and hedged all round with Ymir’s
eyebrows for bulwarks or ramparts. The solid portion of Midgard was surrounded by
the giant’s blood or sweat, which formed the ocean, while his bones made the hills,
his flat teeth the cliffs, and his curly hair the trees and all vegetation.
</p>
<p>Well pleased with the result of their first efforts at creation, the gods now took
the giant’s unwieldy skull and poised it skilfully as the vaulted heavens above earth
and sea; then scattering his brains throughout the expanse beneath they fashioned
from them the fleecy clouds.

<p>To support the heavenly vault, the gods stationed the strong dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri,
Austri, Westri, at its four corners, bidding them sustain it upon their shoulders,
and from them the four points of the compass received their present names of North,
South, East, and West. To give light to the world thus created, the gods studded the
heavenly vault with sparks secured from Muspells-heim, points of light which shone
steadily through the gloom like brilliant stars. The most vivid of these sparks, however,
were reserved for the manufacture of the sun and moon, which were placed in beautiful
golden chariots.

<p>When all these preparations had been finished, and the steeds Arvakr (the early waker)
and Alsvin (the rapid goer) were harnessed to the sun-chariot, the gods, fearing lest
the animals should suffer from their proximity to the ardent sphere, placed under
their withers great skins filled with air or with some refrigerant substance. They
also fashioned the shield Svalin (the cooler), and placed it in front of the car to
shelter them from the sun’s direct rays, which would else have <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>burned them and the earth to a cinder. The moon-car was, similarly, provided with

<p class="first">While the gods were occupied in creating the earth and providing for its illumination,
a whole host of maggot-like creatures had been breeding in Ymir’s flesh. These uncouth
beings now attracted divine attention. Summoning them into their presence, the gods
first gave them forms and endowed them with superhuman intelligence, and then divided
them into two large classes. Those which were dark, treacherous, and cunning by nature
were banished to Svart-alfa-heim, the home of the black dwarfs, situated underground,
whence they were never allowed to come forth during the day, under penalty of being
turned into stone. They were <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>called Dwarfs, Trolls, Gnomes, or Kobolds, and spent all their time and energy in
exploring the secret recesses of the earth. They collected gold, silver, and precious
stones, which they stowed away in secret crevices, whence they could withdraw them
at will. The remainder of these small creatures, including all that were fair, good,
and useful, the gods called Fairies and Elves, and they sent them to dwell in the
airy realm of Alf-heim (home of the light-elves), situated between heaven and earth,
whence they could flit downward whenever they pleased, to attend to the plants and
flowers, sport with the birds and butterflies, or dance in the silvery moonlight on
the green.
</p>
<p>Odin, who had been the leading spirit in all these undertakings, now bade the gods,
his descendants, follow him to the broad plain called Idawold, far above the earth,
on the other side of the great stream Ifing, whose waters never froze.

was held a great council, at which it was decreed that no blood should be shed within
the limits of their realm, or peace-stead, but that harmony should reign there for
ever. As a further result of the conference the gods set up a forge where they fashioned
all their weapons <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>and the tools required to build the magnificent palaces of precious metals, in which
they lived for many long years in a state of such perfect happiness that this period

of man, there were at first no human beings to inhabit it. One day Odin, Vili, and
Ve, according to some authorities, or Odin, Hoenir (the bright one), and Lodur, or
Loki (fire), started out together and walked along the seashore, where they found
either two trees, the ash, Ask, and the elm, Embla, or two blocks of wood, hewn into
rude semblances of the human form. The gods gazed at first upon the inanimate wood
in silent wonder; then, perceiving the use it could be put to, Odin gave these logs
souls, Hoenir bestowed motion and senses, and Lodur contributed blood and blooming
complexions.

<p>Thus endowed with speech and thought, and with power to love and to hope and to work,
and with life and death, the newly created man and woman were left to rule Midgard
at will. They gradually peopled it with their descendants, while the gods, remembering
they had called them into life, took a special interest in all they did, watched over
them, and often vouchsafed their aid and protection.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Allfather next created a huge ash called Yggdrasil, the tree of the universe, of time,
or of life, which filled all the world, taking root not only in the remotest depths
of Nifl-heim, where bubbled the spring Hvergelmir, <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>but also in Midgard, near Mimir’s well (the ocean), and in Asgard, near the Urdar
fountain.
</p>
<p>From its three great roots the tree attained such a marvellous height that its topmost
bough, called Lerad (the peace-giver), overshadowed Odin’s hall, while the other wide-spreading
branches towered over the other worlds. An eagle was perched on the bough Lerad, and
between his eyes sat the falcon Vedfolnir, sending his piercing glances down into
heaven, earth, and Nifl-heim, and reporting all that he saw.
</p>
<p>As the tree Yggdrasil was ever green, its leaves never withering, it served as pasture-ground
not only for Odin’s goat Heidrun, which supplied the heavenly mead, the drink of the
gods, but also for the stags Dain, Dvalin, Duneyr, and Durathor, from whose horns
honey-dew dropped down upon the earth and furnished the water for all the rivers in
the world.
</p>
<p>In the seething cauldron Hvergelmir, close by the great tree, a horrible dragon, called
Nidhug, continually gnawed the roots, and was helped in his work of destruction by
countless worms, whose aim it was to kill the tree, knowing that its death would be
the signal for the downfall of the gods.

it with the holy waters from the Urdar fountain. This water, as it trickled down to
earth through branches and leaves, supplied the bees with honey.
</p>
<p>From either edge of Nifl-heim, arching high above Midgard, rose the sacred bridge,
Bifröst (Asabru, the rainbow), built of fire, water, and air, whose quivering and

<p class="first">None but Odin and his wife and queen Frigga were privileged to use this seat, and
when they occupied it they generally gazed towards the south and west, the goal of
all the hopes and excursions of the Northern nations. Odin was generally represented
as a tall, vigorous man, about fifty years of age, either with dark curling hair or
with a long grey beard and bald head. He was clad in a suit of grey, with a blue hood,
and his muscular body was enveloped in a wide blue mantle flecked with grey—an emblem
of the sky with its fleecy clouds. In his hand Odin generally carried the infallible
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>spear Gungnir, which was so sacred that an oath sworn upon its point could never be
broken, and on his finger or arm he wore the marvellous ring, Draupnir, the emblem
of fruitfulness, precious beyond compare. When seated upon his throne or armed for
the fray, to mingle in which he would often descend to earth, Odin wore his eagle
helmet; but when he wandered peacefully about the earth in human guise, to see what
men were doing, he generally donned a broad-brimmed hat, drawn low over his forehead
to conceal the fact that he possessed but one eye.
</p>
<p>Two ravens, Hugin (thought) and Munin (memory), perched upon his shoulders as he sat
upon his throne, and these he sent out into the wide world every morning, anxiously
watching for their return at nightfall, when they whispered into his ears news of
all they had seen and heard. Thus he was kept well informed about everything that
was happening on earth.

of glittering spears, so highly polished that they illuminated the hall. The roof

<p>The ancient Northern nations, who deemed warfare the most honourable of occupations,
and considered courage the greatest virtue, worshipped Odin principally as god of
battle and victory. They believed that whenever a fight was impending he sent out
his special attendants, the shield-, battle-, or wish-maidens, called Valkyrs (choosers
of the slain), who selected from the dead warriors one-half of their number, whom
they bore on their fleet steeds over the quivering rainbow bridge, Bifröst, into Valhalla.
Welcomed by Odin’s sons, Hermod and Bragi, the heroes were conducted to the foot of
Odin’s throne, where they received the praise due to their valour. When some special
favourite of the god was thus brought into Asgard, Valfather (father of the slain),
as Odin was called when he presided over the warriors, would sometimes rise from his
throne and in person bid him welcome at the great entrance gate.

entertainment was provided for them at the long tables, where the beautiful white-armed
virgins, the Valkyrs, having laid aside their armour and clad themselves in pure white
robes, waited upon them with assiduous attention. These maidens, nine in number according
to some authorities, brought the heroes great horns full of delicious mead, and set
before them huge portions of boar’s flesh, upon which they feasted heartily. The usual
Northern drink was beer or ale, but our ancestors fancied this beverage too coarse
for the heavenly sphere. They therefore imagined that Valfather kept his table liberally
supplied with mead or hydromel, which was daily furnished in great abundance <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>by his she-goat Heidrun, who continually browsed on the tender leaves and twigs on

<p>The meat upon which the Einheriar feasted was the flesh of the divine boar Sæhrimnir,
a marvellous beast, daily slain by the cook Andhrimnir, and boiled in the great cauldron

<p>Moreover, the supply was exhaustless, for the boar always came to life again before
the time of the next meal. This miraculous renewal of supplies in the larder was not
the only wonderful occurrence in Valhalla, for it is related that the warriors, after
having eaten and drunk to satiety, always called for their weapons, armed themselves,
and rode out into the great courtyard, where they fought against one another, repeating
the feats of arms for which they were famed on earth, and recklessly dealing terrible
wounds, which, however, <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>were miraculously and completely healed as soon as the dinner horn sounded.

their feasts in Odin’s beloved presence, while the white-armed Valkyrs, with flying

</p>
<p>As such pleasures were the highest a Northern warrior’s fancy could paint, it was
very natural that all fighting men should love Odin, and early in life should dedicate
themselves to his service. They vowed to die arms in hand, if possible, and even wounded
themselves <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>with their own spears when death drew near, if they had been unfortunate enough to

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Odin, as wind-god, was pictured as rushing through mid-air on his eight-footed steed,
from which originated the oldest Northern riddle, which runs as follows: “<i>Who are the two who ride to the Thing? Three eyes have they together, ten feet, and
one tail: and thus they travel through the lands.</i>” And as the souls of the dead were supposed to be wafted away on the wings of the
storm, Odin was worshipped as the leader of all disembodied spirits. In this character
he was most generally known as the Wild Huntsman, and when people heard the rush and
roar of the wind they cried aloud in superstitious fear, fancying they heard and saw
him ride past with his train, all mounted on snorting steeds, and accompanied by baying
hounds. And the passing of the Wild Hunt, known as Woden’s Hunt, the Raging Host,
Gabriel’s Hounds, or Asgardreia, was also considered a presage of such misfortune
as pestilence or war.

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>The Wild Huntsman (Mrs. Hemans).</i>
</p>
<p>It was further thought that if any were so sacrilegious as to join in the wild halloo
in mockery, they would be immediately snatched up and whirled away with the vanishing
host, while those who joined in the halloo with implicit good faith would be rewarded
by the sudden gift of a horse’s leg, hurled at them from above, which, if carefully
kept until the morrow, would be changed into a lump of gold.
</p>
<p>Even after the introduction of Christianity the ignorant Northern folk still dreaded
the on-coming storm, declaring that it was the Wild Hunt sweeping across the sky.

<p>Sometimes it left behind a small black dog, which, cowering and whining upon a neighbouring
hearth, had to be kept for a whole year and carefully tended unless it could be exorcised
or frightened away. The usual recipe, the same as for the riddance of changelings,
was to brew beer in egg-shells, and this performance was supposed so to startle the
spectral dog that he would fly with his tail between his legs, exclaiming that, although
as old as the Behmer, or Bohemian forest, he had never before beheld such an uncanny
sight.

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Old Saying (Thorpe’s tr.)</i>
</p>
<p>The object of this phantom hunt varied greatly, and was either a visonary boar or
wild horse, white-breasted maidens who were caught and borne away bound only once
in seven years, or the wood nymphs, called Moss Maidens, who were thought to represent
the autumn leaves torn from the trees and whirled away by the wintry gale.
</p>
<p>In the middle ages, when the belief in the old heathen deities was partly forgotten,
the leader of the Wild Hunt was no longer Odin, but Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa,
King Arthur, or some Sabbath-breaker, like the Squire of Rodenstein or Hans von Hackelberg,
who, in punishment for his sins, was condemned to hunt for ever through the realms
of air.
</p>
<p>As the winds blew fiercest in autumn and winter, Odin was supposed to prefer hunting
during that season, especially during the time between Christmas and Twelfth-night,
and the peasants were always careful to leave the last sheaf or measure of grain out
in the fields to serve as food for his horse.
</p>
<p>This hunt was of course known by various names in the different countries of Northern
Europe; but as the tales told about it are all alike, they evidently originated in
the same old heathen belief, and to this day ignorant people of the North fancy that
the baying of a hound on a stormy night is an infallible presage of death.

<p>The Wild Hunt, or Raging Host of Germany, was called Herlathing in England, from the
mythical king Herla, its supposed leader; in Northern France it bore the name of <i>Mesnée d’Hellequin</i>, from Hel, goddess of death; and in the middle ages it was known as Cain’s Hunt or
Herod’s Hunt, these latter names being given because the leaders were supposed to
be unable to find rest on account of the iniquitous murders of Abel, of John the Baptist,
and of the Holy Innocents.
</p>
<p>In Central France the Wild Huntsman, whom we have already seen in other countries
as Odin, Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Rodenstein, von Hackelberg, King Arthur, Hel, one
of the Swedish kings, Gabriel, Cain, or Herod, is also called the Great Huntsman of
Fontainebleau (<i>le Grand Veneur de Fontainebleau</i>), and people declare that on the eve of Henry IV.’s murder, and also just before
the outbreak of the great French Revolution, his shouts were distinctly heard as he
swept across the sky.
</p>
<p>It was generally believed among the Northern nations that the soul escaped from the
body in the shape of a mouse, which crept out of a corpse’s mouth and ran away, and
it was also said to creep in and out of the mouths of people in a trance. While the
soul was absent, no effort or remedy could recall the patient to life; but as soon
as it had come back animation returned.

<h3 class="main">The Pied Piper</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As Odin was the leader of all disembodied spirits, he was identified in the middle
ages with the Pied Piper of Hamelin. According to mediæval legends, Hamelin was so
infested by rats that life became unbearable, and a large reward was offered to any
who would rid the town of these rodents. A piper, in parti-coloured garments, offered
to undertake the commission, and the terms being accepted, he commenced to play through
the streets in such wise that, one and all, the rats were beguiled out of their holes
until they formed a vast procession. There was that in the strains which compelled
them to follow, until at last the river Weser was reached, and all were drowned in
its tide.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,
</p>
<p class="line">You heard as if an army muttered;
</p>
<p class="line">And the muttering grew to a grumbling;

<p class="line">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
</p>
<p class="line">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
</p>
<p class="line">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
</p>
<p class="line">Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Robert Browning.</i>
</p>
<p>As the rats were all dead, and there was no chance of their returning to plague them,
the people of Hamelin refused to pay the reward, and they bade the piper do his worst.
He took them at their word, and a few <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>moments later the weird strains of the magic flute again arose, and this time it was
the children who swarmed out of the houses and merrily followed the piper.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling

<p>The burghers were powerless to prevent the tragedy, and as they stood spellbound the
piper led the children out of the town to the Koppelberg, a hill on the confines of
the town, which miraculously opened to receive the procession, and only closed again
when the last child had passed out of sight. This legend probably originated the adage
“to pay the piper.” The children were never seen in Hamelin again, and in commemoration
of this public calamity all official decrees have since been dated so many years after
the Pied Piper’s visit.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another German legend which owes its existence to this belief is the story of Bishop
Hatto, the miserly prelate, who, annoyed by the clamours of the poor during a time
of famine, had them burned alive in a deserted barn, like the rats whom he declared
they resembled, rather than give them some of the precious grain which he had laid
up for himself.

<p>Soon after this terrible crime had been accomplished the bishop’s retainers reported
the approach of a vast swarm of rats. These, it appears, were the souls of the murdered
peasants, which had assumed the forms of the rats to which the bishop had likened
them. His efforts to escape were vain, and the rats pursued him even into the middle
of the Rhine, to a stone tower in which he took refuge from their fangs. They swam
to the tower, gnawed their way through the stone walls, and, pouring in on all sides
at once, they found the bishop and devoured him alive.

<div class="lgouter">

the path which we know as the Milky Way, but which the ancient Germans designated
as Irmin’s Way. This chariot, whose rumbling sound occasionally became perceptible
to mortal ears as thunder, never left the sky, where it can still be seen in the constellation

<p class="first">To obtain the great wisdom for which he is so famous, Odin, in the morn of time, visited
Mimir’s (Memor, memory) spring, “the fountain of all wit and wisdom,” in whose liquid
depths even the future was clearly mirrored, and besought the old man who guarded
it to <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>let him have a draught. But Mimir, who well knew the value of such a favour (for his
spring was considered the source or headwater of memory), refused the boon unless
Odin would consent to give one of his eyes in exchange.
</p>
<p>The god did not hesitate, so highly did he prize the draught, but immediately plucked
out one of his eyes, which Mimir kept in pledge, sinking it deep down into his fountain,
where it shone with mild lustre, leaving Odin with but one eye, which is considered
emblematic of the sun.

<div class="lgouter">

<p>Drinking deeply of Mimir’s fount, Odin gained the knowledge he coveted, and he never

a branch of the sacred tree Yggdrasil, which overshadowed the spring, and fashioned
from it his beloved spear Gungnir.

of the gods, who were doomed to pass away. This knowledge so affected his spirits
that he ever after wore a melancholy and contemplative expression.
</p>
<p>To test the value of the wisdom he had thus obtained, Odin went to visit the most
learned of all the giants, Vafthrudnir, and entered with him into a contest of wit,
in which the stake was nothing less than the loser’s head.

when asked his name declared it was Gangrad. The contest of wit immediately began,
Vafthrudnir questioning his guest concerning the horses which carried Day and Night
across the sky, the river Ifing separating Jötun-heim from Asgard, and also about
Vigrid, the field where the last battle was to be fought.
</p>
<p>All these questions were minutely answered by Odin, who, when Vafthrudnir had ended,
began the interrogatory in his turn, and received equally explicit answers about the
origin of heaven and earth, the creation of the gods, their quarrel with the Vanas,
the occupations of the heroes in Valhalla, the offices of the Norns, and the rulers
who were to replace the Æsir when they had all perished with the world they had created.
But when, in conclusion, Odin bent near the giant and softly inquired what words Allfather
whispered to his dead son Balder as he lay upon his funeral pyre, Vafthrudnir <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>suddenly recognised his divine visitor. Starting back in dismay, he declared that
no one but Odin himself could answer that question, and that it was now quite plain
to him that he had madly striven in a contest of wisdom and wit with the king of the
gods, and fully deserved the penalty of failure, the loss of his head.

<p>When he had fully mastered this knowledge, Odin cut magic runes upon his spear Gungnir,
upon the teeth of his horse Sleipnir, upon the claws of the bear, and upon countless
other animate and inanimate things. And because he had thus hung over the abyss for
such a long space of time, he was ever after considered the patron divinity of all
who were condemned to be hanged or who perished by the noose.
</p>
<p>After obtaining the gift of wisdom and runes, which gave him power over all things,
Odin also coveted the gift of eloquence and poetry, which he acquired in a manner
which we shall relate in a subsequent chapter.

<h3 class="main">Geirrod and Agnar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Odin, as has already been stated, took great interest in the affairs of mortals, and,
we are told, was specially fond of watching King Hrauding’s handsome little sons,
Geirrod and Agnar, when they were about eight and ten years of age respectively. One
day these little lads went fishing, and a storm suddenly arose which blew their boat
far out to sea, where it finally stranded upon an island, upon which dwelt a seeming
old couple, who in reality were Odin and Frigga in disguise. They <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>had assumed these forms in order to indulge a sudden passion for the close society
of their <i>protégés</i>. The lads were warmly welcomed and kindly treated, Odin choosing Geirrod as his favourite,
and teaching him the use of arms, while Frigga petted and made much of little Agnar.
The boys tarried on the island with their kind protectors during the long, cold winter
season; but when spring came, and the skies were blue, and the sea calm, they embarked
in a boat which Odin provided, and set out for their native shore. Favoured by gentle
breezes, they were soon wafted thither; but as the boat neared the strand Geirrod
quickly sprang out and pushed it far back into the water, bidding his brother sail
away into the evil spirit’s power. At that self-same moment the wind veered, and Agnar
was indeed carried away, while his brother hastened to his father’s palace with a
lying tale as to what had happened to his brother. He was joyfully received as one
from the dead, and in due time he succeeded his father upon the throne.
</p>
<p>Years passed by, during which the attention of Odin had been claimed by other high
considerations, when one day, while the divine couple were seated on the throne Hlidskialf,
Odin suddenly remembered the winter’s sojourn on the desert island, and he bade his
wife notice how powerful his pupil had become, and taunted her because her favourite
Agnar had married a giantess and had remained poor and of no consequence. Frigga quietly
replied that it was better to be poor than hardhearted, and accused Geirrod of lack
of hospitality—one of the most heinous crimes in the eyes of a Northman. She even
went so far as to declare that in spite of all his wealth he often ill-treated his
guests.
</p>
<p>When Odin heard this accusation he declared that he <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>would prove the falsity of the charge by assuming the guise of a Wanderer and testing
Geirrod’s generosity. Wrapped in his cloud-hued raiment, with slouch hat and pilgrim
staff,—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Wanderer calls me the world,
</p>
<p class="line">Far have I carried my feet,

</p>
<p class="line">I have boundlessly been,”—</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Wagner (Forman’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Odin immediately set out by a roundabout way, while Frigga, to outwit him, immediately
despatched a swift messenger to warn Geirrod to beware of a man in wide mantle and
broad-brimmed hat, as he was a wicked enchanter who would work him ill.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>When, therefore, Odin presented himself before the king’s palace he was dragged into
Geirrod’s presence and questioned roughly. He gave his name as Grimnir, but refused
to tell whence he came or what he wanted, so as this reticence confirmed the suspicion
suggested to the mind of Geirrod, he allowed his love of cruelty full play, and commanded
that the stranger should be bound between two fires, in such wise that the flames
played around him without quite touching him, and he remained thus eight days and
nights, in obstinate silence, without food. Now Agnar had returned secretly to his
brother’s palace, where he occupied a menial position, and one night when all was
still, in pity for the suffering of the unfortunate captive, he conveyed to his lips
a horn of ale. But for this Odin would have had nothing to drink—the most serious
of all trials to the god.
</p>
<p>At the end of the eighth day, while Geirrod, seated upon his throne, was gloating
over his prisoner’s sufferings, Odin began to sing—softly at first, then louder and
louder, until the hall re-echoed with his triumphant <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>notes—a prophecy that the king, who had so long enjoyed the god’s favour, would soon
perish by his own sword.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The fallen by the sword
</p>
<p class="line">Ygg shall now have;
</p>

<p class="line">Draw near to me if thou canst.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sæmund’s Edda (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>As the last notes died away the chains dropped from his hands, the flames flickered
and went out, and Odin stood in the midst of the hall, no longer in human form, but
in all the power and beauty of a god.
</p>
<p>On hearing the ominous prophecy Geirrod hastily drew his sword, intending to slay
the insolent singer; but when he beheld the sudden transformation he started in dismay,
tripped, fell upon the sharp blade, and perished as Odin had just foretold. Turning
to Agnar, who, according to some accounts, was the king’s son, and not his brother,
for these old stories are often strangely confused, Odin bade him ascend the throne
in reward for his humanity, and, further to repay him for the timely draught of ale,
he promised to bless him with all manner of prosperity.
</p>
<p>On another occasion Odin wandered to earth, and was absent so long that the gods began
to think that they would not see him in Asgard again. This encouraged his brothers
Vili and Ve, who by some mythologists are considered as other personifications of
himself, to usurp his power and his throne, and even, we are told, to espouse his
wife Frigga.

<h3 class="main">May-Day Festivals</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But upon Odin’s return the usurpers vanished for ever; and in commemoration of the
disappearance of the false Odin, who had ruled seven months and had brought nothing
but unhappiness to the world, and of the return of the benevolent deity, the heathen
Northmen formerly celebrated yearly festivals, which were long continued as May Day
rejoicings. Until very lately there was always, on that day, a grand procession in
Sweden, known as the May Ride, in which a flower-decked May king (Odin) pelted with
blossoms the fur-enveloped Winter (his supplanter), until he put him to ignominious
flight. In England also the first of May was celebrated as a festive occasion, in
which May-pole dances, May queens, Maid Marian, and Jack in the Green played prominent
parts.
</p>
<p>As personification of heaven, Odin, of course, was the lover and spouse of the earth,
and as to them the earth bore a threefold aspect, the Northmen depicted him as a polygamist,
and allotted to him several wives. The first among these was Jörd (Erda), the primitive
earth, daughter of Night or of the giantess Fiorgyn. She bore him his famous son Thor,
the god of thunder. The second and principal wife was Frigga, a personification of
the civilised world. She gave him Balder, the gentle god of spring, Hermod, and, according
to some authorities, Tyr. The third wife was Rinda, a personification of the hard
and frozen earth, who reluctantly yields to his warm embrace, but finally gives birth
to Vali, the emblem of vegetation.
</p>
<p>Odin is also said to have married Saga or Laga, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>goddess of history (hence our verb “to say”), and to have daily visited her in the
crystal hall of Sokvabek, beneath a cool, ever-flowing river, to drink its waters
and listen to her songs about olden times and vanished races.

<div class="lgouter">

<h3 class="main">The Historical Odin</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides this ancient Odin, there was a more modern, semi-historical personage of the
same name, to whom all the virtues, powers, and adventures of his predecessor have
been attributed. He was the chief of the Æsir, inhabitants of Asia Minor, who, sore
pressed by the Romans, and threatened with destruction or slavery, left their native
land about 70 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, and migrated into Europe. This Odin is said to have conquered Russia, Germany, Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden, leaving a son on the throne of each conquered country. He also
built the town of Odensö. He was welcomed in Sweden by Gylfi, the king, who gave him
a share of the realm, and allowed him to found the city of Sigtuna, where he built
a temple and introduced a new system of worship. Tradition further relates that as
his end drew near, this mythical Odin assembled his followers, publicly cut himself
nine times in the breast with his spear,—a ceremony called “carving Geir odds,”—and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>told them he was about to return to his native land Asgard, his old home, where he
would await their coming, to share with him a life of feasting, drinking, and fighting.
</p>
<p>According to another account, Gylfi, having heard of the power of the Æsir, the inhabitants
of Asgard, and wishing to ascertain whether these reports were true, journeyed to
the south. In due time he came to Odin’s palace, where he was expected, and where
he was deluded by the vision of Har, Iafn-har, and Thridi, three divinities, enthroned
one above the other. The gatekeeper, Gangler, answered all his questions, and gave
him a long explanation of Northern mythology, which is recorded in the Younger Edda,
and then, having finished his instructions, suddenly vanished with the palace amid
a deafening noise.
</p>
<p>According to other very ancient poems, Odin’s sons, Weldegg, Beldegg, Sigi, Skiold,
Sæming, and Yngvi, became kings of East Saxony, West Saxony, Franconia, Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden, and from them are descended the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, and the royal
families of the Northern lands. Still another version relates that Odin and Frigga
had seven sons, who founded the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy. In the course of time this
mysterious king was confounded with the Odin whose worship he introduced, and all
his deeds were attributed to the god.
</p>
<p>Odin was worshipped in numerous temples, but especially in the great fane at Upsala,
where the most solemn festivals were held, and where sacrifices were offered. The
victim was generally a horse, but in times of pressing need human offerings were made,
even the king being once offered up to avert a famine.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Viking Tales of the North (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first toast at every festival here was drunk in his honour, and, besides the first
of May, one day in every week was held sacred to him, and, from his Saxon name, Woden,
was called Woden’s day, whence the English word “Wednesday” has been derived. It was
customary for the people to assemble at his shrine on festive occasions, to hear the
songs of the scalds, who were rewarded for their minstrelsy by the gift of golden
bracelets or armlets, which curled up at the ends and were called “Odin’s serpents.”
</p>
<p>There are but few remains of ancient Northern art now extant, and although rude statues
of Odin were once quite common they have all disappeared, as they were made of wood—a
perishable substance, which in the hands of the missionaries, and especially of Olaf
the Saint, the Northern iconoclast, was soon reduced to ashes.

<p>Odin himself is supposed to have given his people a code of laws whereby to govern

Edda. In this lay he taught the fallibility of man, the necessity for courage, temperance,
independence, and truthfulness, respect for old age, hospitality, charity, and contentment,
and gave instructions for the burial of the dead.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Frigga, or Frigg, daughter of Fiorgyn and sister of Jörd, according to some mythologists,
is considered by others as a daughter of Jörd and Odin, whom she eventually married.
This wedding caused such general rejoicing in Asgard, where the goddess was greatly
beloved, that ever after it was customary to celebrate its anniversary with feast
and song, and the goddess being declared patroness of marriage, her health was always
proposed with that of Odin and Thor at wedding feasts.

<p class="first">J.&nbsp;C. Dollman</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Frigga was goddess of the atmosphere, or rather of the clouds, and as such was represented
as wearing either snow-white or dark garments, according to her somewhat variable
moods. She was queen of the gods, and she alone had the privilege of sitting on the
throne Hlidskialf, beside her august husband. From thence she too could look over
all the world and see what was happening, and, according to the belief of our ancestors,
she possessed the knowledge of the future, which, however, no one could ever prevail
upon her to reveal, thus proving that Northern women could keep a secret inviolate.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Of me the gods are sprung;
</p>
<p class="line">And all that is to come I know, but lock
</p>
<p class="line">In my own breast, and have to none reveal’d.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>She was generally represented as a tall, beautiful, and stately woman, crowned with
heron plumes, the symbol of silence or forgetfulness, and clothed in pure white robes,
secured at the waist by a golden girdle, from which hung a bunch of keys, the distinctive
sign <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>of the Northern housewife, whose special patroness she was said to be. Although she
often appeared beside her husband, Frigga preferred to remain in her own palace, called
Fensalir, the hall of mists or of the sea, where she diligently plied her wheel or
distaff, spinning golden thread or weaving long webs of bright-coloured clouds.
</p>
<p>In order to perform this work she made use of a marvellous jewelled spinning wheel
or distaff, which at night shone brightly in the sky as a constellation, known in
the North as Frigga’s Spinning Wheel, while the inhabitants of the South called the
same stars Orion’s Girdle.
</p>
<p>To her hall Fensalir the gracious goddess invited husbands and wives who had led virtuous
lives on earth, so that they might enjoy each other’s companionship even after death,
and never be called upon to part again.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There in the glen, Fensalir stands, the house

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>Frigga was therefore considered the goddess of conjugal and motherly love, and was
specially worshipped by married lovers and tender parents. This exalted office did
not entirely absorb her thoughts however, for we are told that she was very fond of
dress, and whenever she appeared before the assembled gods her attire was rich and
becoming, and her jewels chosen with much taste.

<h3 class="main">The Stolen Gold</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Frigga’s love of adornment once led her sadly astray, for, in her longing to possess
some new ornament, she secretly purloined a piece of gold from a statue representing
her husband, which had just been placed <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>in his temple. The stolen metal was entrusted to the dwarfs, with instructions to
fashion a marvellous necklace for her use. This, when finished, was so resplendent
that it greatly enhanced her charms, and even increased Odin’s love for her. But when
he discovered the theft of the gold he angrily summoned the dwarfs and bade them reveal
who had dared to touch his statue. Unwilling to betray the queen of the gods, the
dwarfs remained obstinately silent, and, seeing that no information could be elicited
from them, Odin commanded that the statue should be placed above the temple gate,
and set to work to devise runes which should endow it with the power of speech and
enable it to denounce the thief. When Frigga heard these tidings she trembled with
fear, and implored her favourite attendant, Fulla, to invent some means of protecting
her from Allfather’s wrath. Fulla, who was always ready to serve her mistress, immediately
departed, and soon returned, accompanied by a hideous dwarf, who promised to prevent
the statue from speaking if Frigga would only deign to smile graciously upon him.
This boon having been granted, the dwarf hastened off to the temple, caused a deep
sleep to fall upon the guards, and while they were thus unconscious, pulled the statue
down from its pedestal and broke it to pieces, so that it could never betray Frigga’s
theft, in spite of all Odin’s efforts to give it the power of speech.
</p>
<p>Odin, discovering this sacrilege on the morrow, was very angry indeed; so angry that
he left Asgard and utterly disappeared, carrying away with him all the blessings which
he had been wont to shower upon gods and men. According to some authorities, his brothers,
as we have already seen, took advantage of his absence to assume his form and secure
possession of his throne and wife; but although they looked exactly like him <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>they could not restore the lost blessings, and allowed the ice-giants, or Jotuns,
to invade the earth and bind it fast in their cold fetters. These wicked giants pinched
the leaves and buds till they all shrivelled up, stripped the trees bare, shrouded
the earth in a great white coverlet, and veiled it in impenetrable mists.
</p>
<p>But at the end of seven weary months the true Odin relented and returned, and when
he saw all the evil that had been done he drove the usurpers away, forced the frost-giants
to relax their grip of the earth and to release her from her icy bonds, and again
showered all his blessings down upon her, cheering her with the light of his smile.

<h3 class="main">Odin Outwitted</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As has already been seen, Odin, although god of wit and wisdom, was sometimes no match
for his wife Frigga, who, womanlike, was sure to obtain her way by some means. On
one occasion the august pair were seated upon Hlidskialf, gazing with interest upon
the Winilers and Vandals, who were preparing for a battle which was to decide which
people should henceforth have supremacy. Odin gazed with satisfaction upon the Vandals,
who were loudly praying to him for victory; but Frigga watched the movements of the
Winilers with more attention, because they had entreated her aid. She therefore turned
to Odin and coaxingly inquired whom he meant to favour on the morrow; he, wishing
to evade her question, declared he would not decide, as it was time for bed, but would
give the victory to those upon whom his eyes first rested in the morning.
</p>
<p>This answer was shrewdly calculated, for Odin knew that his couch was so turned that
upon waking he would face the Vandals, and he intended looking out <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>from thence, instead of waiting until he had mounted his throne. But, although so
cunningly contrived, this plan was frustrated by Frigga, who, divining his purpose,
waited until he was sound asleep, and then noiselessly turned his couch so that he
should face her favourites. Then she sent word to the Winilers to dress their women
in armour and send them out in battle array at dawn, with their long hair carefully
combed down over their cheeks and breasts.

in surprise, “What Longbeards are those?” (In German the ancient word for long beards
was <i>Langobarden</i>, which was the name used to designate the Lombards.) Frigga, upon hearing this exclamation,
which she had foreseen, immediately cried out in triumph that Allfather had given

also a baptismal gift.

advised her how best to help the mortals who implored her aid. Fulla was very beautiful
indeed, and had long golden hair, which she wore flowing loose over her shoulders,
restrained only by a golden circlet or snood. As her hair was emblematic of the golden
grain, this circlet represented the binding of the sheaf. Fulla was also known as
Abundia, or Abundantia, in some parts of Germany, where she was considered the symbol

<p class="first">Gna was Frigga’s swift messenger. Mounted upon her fleet steed Hofvarpnir (hoof-thrower),
she would travel with marvellous rapidity through fire and air, over land and sea,
and was therefore considered the personification of the refreshing breeze. Darting
thus to and fro, Gna saw all that was happening upon earth, and told her mistress
all she knew. On one occasion, as she was passing over Hunaland, she saw King Rerir,
a lineal descendant of Odin, sitting mournfully by the shore, bewailing his childlessness.
The queen of heaven, who was also goddess of childbirth, upon hearing this took an
apple (the emblem of fruitfulness) from her private store, gave it to Gna, and bade
her carry it to the king. With the rapidity of the element she personified, Gna darted
away, and as she passed over Rerir’s head, she dropped her apple into his lap with
a radiant smile.

one of the giants, by whom she had four sons. This same tradition goes on to declare
that Odin sent her before him to visit Gylfi, King of Sweden, and to beg for some
land which she might call her own. The king, amused at her request, promised her as
much land as she could plough around in one day and night. Gefjon, nothing daunted,
changed her four sons into oxen, harnessed them to a plough, and began to cut a furrow
so wide and deep that the king and his courtiers were amazed. But Gefjon continued
her work without showing any signs of fatigue, and when she had ploughed all around
a large piece of land forcibly wrenched it away, and made her <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>oxen drag it down into the sea, where she made it fast and called it Seeland.

rich gifts. As she presided over the weather, the people were wont to declare when
the snowflakes fell that Frau Holle was shaking her bed, and when it rained, that
she was washing her clothes, often pointing to the white clouds as her linen which
she had put out to bleach. When long grey strips of clouds drifted across the sky
they said she was weaving, for she was supposed to be also a very diligent weaver,
spinner, and housekeeper. It is said she gave flax to mankind and taught them how
to use it, and in the Tyrol the following story is told about the way in which she

his sheep up the mountain to pasture; and as he watched his flock grazing on the mountain-side,
he often had opportunity to use his cross-bow and bring down a chamois, whose flesh
would furnish his larder with food for many a day.
</p>
<p>While pursuing a fine animal one day he saw it disappear behind a boulder, and when
he came to the spot, he was amazed to see a doorway in the neighbouring <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>glacier, for in the excitement of the pursuit he had climbed higher and higher, until
he was now on top of the mountain, where glittered the everlasting snow.

<p>The shepherd boldly passed through the open door, and soon found himself in a wonderful
jewelled cave hung with stalactites, in the centre of which stood a beautiful woman,
clad in silvery robes, and attended by a host of lovely maidens crowned with Alpine
roses. In his surprise, the shepherd sank to his knees, and as in a dream heard the
queenly central figure bid him choose anything he saw to carry away with him. Although
dazzled by the glow of the precious stones around him, the shepherd’s eyes constantly
reverted to a little nosegay of blue flowers which the gracious apparition held in
her hand, and he now timidly proffered a request that it might become his. Smiling
with pleasure, Holda, for it was she, gave it to him, telling him he had chosen wisely
and would live as long as the flowers did not droop and fade. Then, giving the shepherd
a measure of seed which she told him to sow in his field, the goddess bade him begone;
and as the thunder pealed and the earth shook, the poor man found himself out upon
the mountain-side once more, and slowly wended his way home to his wife, to whom he
told his adventure and showed the lovely blue flowers and the measure of seed.
</p>
<p>The woman reproached her husband bitterly for not having brought some of the precious
stones which he so glowingly described, instead of the blossoms and seed; nevertheless
the man proceeded to sow the latter, and he found to his surprise that the measure
supplied seed enough for several acres.
</p>
<p>Soon the little green shoots began to appear, and one moonlight night, while the peasant
was gazing upon them, as was his wont, for he felt a curious attraction <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>to the field which he had sown, and often lingered there wondering what kind of grain
would be produced, he saw a misty form hover above the field, with hands outstretched
as if in blessing. At last the field blossomed, and countless little blue flowers
opened their calyxes to the golden sun. When the flowers had withered and the seed
was ripe, Holda came once more to teach the peasant and his wife how to harvest the
flax—for such it was—and from it to spin, weave, and bleach linen. As the people of
the neighbourhood willingly purchased both linen and flax-seed, the peasant and his
wife soon grew very rich indeed, and while he ploughed, sowed, and harvested, she
spun, wove, and bleached the linen. The man lived to a good old age, and saw his grandchildren
and great-grandchildren grow up around him. All this time his carefully treasured
bouquet had remained fresh as when he first brought it home, but one day he saw that
during the night the flowers had drooped and were dying.
</p>
<p>Knowing what this portended, and that he too must die, the peasant climbed the mountain
once more to the glacier, and found again the doorway for which he had often vainly
searched. He entered the icy portal, and was never seen or heard of again, for, according
to the legend, the goddess took him under her care, and bade him live in her cave,
where his every wish was gratified.

where she was known as Frau Venus, and was considered as an enchantress who lured
mortals into her realm, where she detained them for ever, steeping their senses in
all manner of sensual pleasures. The most famous of her victims was Tannhäuser, who,
after he had lived under <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>her spell for a season, experienced a revulsion of feeling which loosened her bonds
over his spirit and induced anxious thoughts concerning his soul. He escaped from
her power and hastened to Rome to confess his sins and seek absolution. But when the
Pope heard of his association with one of the pagan goddesses whom the priests taught
were nothing but demons, he declared that the knight could no more hope for pardon
than to see his staff bear buds and bloom.

where he vanished within the cave. He had no sooner disappeared, however, than the

had miraculously bloomed, thus proving to all that there was no sin too heinous to
be pardoned, providing repentance were sincere.

she inspected her domain. This vehicle having once suffered damage, the goddess bade
a wheelwright repair it, and when he had finished told him to keep some chips as his

number; but to his surprise he found these on the morrow changed to gold.

<p class="first">The Saxon goddess Eástre, or Ostara, goddess of spring, whose name has survived in
the English word Easter, is also identical with Frigga, for she too is considered
goddess of the earth, or rather of Nature’s resurrection after the long death of winter.
This gracious goddess was so dearly loved by the old Teutons, that even after Christianity
had been introduced they retained so pleasant a recollection of her, that they refused
to have her degraded to the rank of a demon, like many of their other divinities,
and transferred her name to their great Christian feast. It had long been customary
to celebrate this day by the exchange of presents of coloured eggs, for the egg is
the type of the beginning of life; so the early Christians continued to observe this
rule, declaring, however, that the egg is also symbolical of the Resurrection. In
various parts of Germany, <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>stone altars can still be seen, which are known as Easter-stones, because they were
dedicated to the fair goddess Ostara. They were crowned with flowers by the young
people, who danced gaily around them by the light of great bonfires,—a species of
popular games practised until the middle of the present century, in spite of the priests’
denunciations and of the repeatedly published edicts against them.

<h3 class="main">Bertha, the White Lady</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In other parts of Germany, Frigga, Holda, or Ostara is known by the name of Brechta,
Bertha, or the White Lady. She is best known under this title in Thuringia, where
she was supposed to dwell in a hollow mountain, keeping watch over the Heimchen, souls
of unborn children, and of those who died unbaptized. Here Bertha watched over agriculture,
caring for the plants, which her infant troop watered carefully, for each babe was
supposed to carry a little jar for that express purpose. While the goddess was duly
respected and her retreat unmolested, she remained where she was; but tradition relates
that she once left the country with her infant train dragging her plough, and settled
elsewhere to continue her kind ministrations. Bertha is the legendary ancestress of
several noble families, and she is supposed to be the same as the industrious queen
of the same name, the mythical mother of Charlemagne, whose era has become proverbial,
for in speaking of the Golden Age in France and Germany it is customary to say, “in
the days when Bertha spun.”
</p>
<p>As this Bertha is supposed to have developed a very large and flat foot, from continually
pressing the treadle of her wheel, she is often represented in mediæval art as a woman
with a splay foot, and hence known as <i>la reine pédauque</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>As ancestress of the imperial house of Germany, the White Lady is supposed to appear
in the palace before a death or misfortune in the family, and this superstition is
still so rife in Germany, that the newspapers in 1884 contained the official report
of a sentinel, who declared that he had seen her flit past him in one of the palace
corridors.
</p>
<p>As Bertha was renowned for her spinning, she naturally was regarded as the special
patroness of that branch of female industry, and was said to flit through the streets
of every village, at nightfall, during the twelve nights between Christmas and January
6, peering into every window to inspect the spinning of the household.
</p>
<p>The maidens whose work had been carefully performed were rewarded by a present of
one of her own golden threads or a distaff full of extra fine flax; but wherever a
careless spinner was found, her wheel was broken, her flax soiled, and if she had
failed to honour the goddess by eating plenty of the cakes baked at that period of
the year, she was cruelly punished.
</p>
<p>In Mecklenburg, this same goddess is known as Frau Gode, or Wode, the female form
of Wuotan or Odin, and her appearance is always considered the harbinger of great
prosperity. She is also supposed to be a great huntress, and to lead the Wild Hunt,
mounted upon a white horse, her attendants being changed into hounds and all manner
of wild beasts.
</p>
<p>In Holland she was called Vrou-elde, and from her the Milky Way is known by the Dutch
as <i>Vrou-elden-straat</i>; while in parts of Northern Germany she was called Nerthus (Mother Earth). Her sacred
car was kept on an island, presumably Rügen, where the priests guarded it carefully
until she appeared to take a yearly journey throughout her realm to bless the land.
The goddess, her face completely hidden by a thick veil, <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>then sat in this car, which was drawn by two cows, and she was respectfully escorted
by her priests. When she passed, the people did homage by ceasing all warfare, and
laying aside their weapons. They donned festive attire, and began no quarrel until
the goddess had again retired to her sanctuary. Then both car and goddess were bathed
in a secret lake (the Schwartze See, in Rügen), which swallowed up the slaves who
had assisted at the bathing, and once more the priests resumed their watch over the
sanctuary and grove of Nerthus or Hlodyn, to await her next appearance.

which trailed from beneath their long snow-white garments. These Huldra folk were

but others state that his mother was Frigga, queen of the gods. This child was very
remarkable for his great size and strength, and very soon after his birth amazed the
assembled gods by playfully lifting and throwing about ten great bales of bear skins.
Although generally good-tempered, Thor would occasionally fly into a terrible rage,
and as he was very dangerous at these times, his mother, unable to control him, sent
him away from home and entrusted him to the care of Vingnir (the winged), and of Hlora
(heat). These foster-parents, who are also considered as the personification of sheet-lightning,
soon managed to control their troublesome charge, and brought him up so wisely, that
the gods entertained a very grateful recollection of their kind offices. Thor himself,
recognising all he owed them, assumed the names of Vingthor and Hlorridi, by which
he is also known.

<p>Having attained his full growth and the age of reason, Thor was admitted to Asgard
among the other gods, where he occupied one of the twelve seats in the great judgment
hall. He was also given the realm of Thrud-vang or Thrud-heim, where he built a wonderful
palace called Bilskirnir (lightning), the most spacious in all Asgard. It contained
five hundred and forty halls for the accommodation of the thralls, who after death
were welcomed to his home, where they received equal <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>treatment with their masters in Valhalla, for Thor was the patron god of the peasants

<p>As this huge hammer, the emblem of the thunderbolts, was generally red-hot, the god
had an iron gauntlet called Iarn-greiper, which enabled him to grasp it firmly. He

</p>
<p>Thor’s hammer was considered so very sacred by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>ancient Northern people, that they were wont to make the sign of the hammer, as the
Christians later taught them to make the sign of the cross, to ward off all evil influences,
and to secure blessings. The same sign was also made over the newly born infant when
water was poured over its head and a name given. The hammer was used to drive in boundary
stakes, which it was considered sacrilegious to remove, to hallow the threshold of
a new house, to solemnise a marriage, and, lastly, it played a part in the consecration
of the funeral pyre upon which the bodies of heroes, together with their weapons and
steeds, and, in some cases, with their wives and dependents, were burned.
</p>
<p>In Sweden, Thor, like Odin, was supposed to wear a broad-brimmed hat, and hence the
storm-clouds in that country are known as Thor’s hat, a name also given to one of
the principal mountains in Norway. The rumble and roar of the thunder were said to
be the roll of his chariot, for he alone among the gods never rode on horseback, but
walked, or drove in a brazen chariot drawn by two goats, Tanngniostr (tooth-cracker),
and Tanngrisnr (tooth-gnasher), from whose teeth and hoofs the sparks constantly flew.

</p>
<p>When the god thus drove from place to place, he was called Aku-thor, or Thor the charioteer,
and in Southern Germany the people, fancying a brazen chariot alone inadequate to
furnish all the noise they heard, declared it was loaded with copper kettles, which
rattled and clashed, and therefore often called him, with disrespectful familiarity,
the kettle-vendor.

<h3 class="main">Thor’s Family</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thor was twice married; first to the giantess Iarnsaxa (iron stone), who bore him
two sons, Magni (strength) and Modi (courage), both destined to survive their father
and the twilight of the gods, and rule over the new world which was to rise like a
phœnix from the ashes of the first. His second wife was Sif, the golden-haired, who
also bore him two children, Lorride, and a daughter named Thrud, a young giantess
renowned for her size and strength. True to the well-known affinity of contrast, Thrud
was wooed by the dwarf Alvis, whom she rather favoured; and one evening, when this
suitor, who, being a dwarf, could not face the light of day, presented himself in
Asgard to sue for her hand, the assembled gods did not refuse their consent. They
had scarcely signified their approbation, however, when Thor, who had been absent,
suddenly appeared, and casting a glance of contempt upon the puny lover, declared
he would have to prove that his knowledge atoned for his small stature, before he
could win his bride.
</p>
<p>To test Alvis’s mental powers, Thor then questioned him in the language of the gods,
Vanas, elves, and dwarfs, artfully prolonging his examination until sunrise, when
the first beam of light, falling upon the unhappy dwarf, petrified him. There he stood,
an enduring example of the gods’ power, to serve as a warning to all other dwarfs
who might dare to test it.

<h3 class="main">Sif, the Golden-haired</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sif, Thor’s wife, was very vain of a magnificent head of long golden hair which covered
her from head to foot like a brilliant veil; and as she too was a symbol of the earth,
her hair was said to represent the long grass, or the golden grain covering the Northern
harvest fields. Thor was very proud of his wife’s beautiful hair; imagine his dismay,
therefore, upon waking one morning, to find her shorn, and as bald and denuded of
ornament as the earth when the grain has been garnered, and nothing but the stubble
remains! In his anger, Thor sprang to his feet, vowing he would punish the perpetrator
of this outrage, whom he immediately and rightly conjectured to be Loki, the arch-plotter,
ever on the look-out for some evil deed to perform. Seizing his hammer, Thor went
in search of Loki, who attempted to evade the irate god by changing his form. But
it was all to no purpose; Thor soon overtook him, and without more ado caught him
by the throat, and almost strangled him ere he yielded to his imploring signs and
relaxed his powerful grip. When he could draw his breath, Loki begged forgiveness,
but all his entreaties were vain, until he promised to procure for Sif a new head
of hair, as beautiful as the first, and as luxuriant in growth.

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And thence for Sif new tresses I’ll bring

</p>
<p>Then Thor consented to let the traitor go; so Loki rapidly crept down into the bowels
of the earth, where Svart-alfa-heim was situated, to beg the dwarf Dvalin to <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>fashion not only the precious hair, but a present for Odin and Frey, whose anger he
wished to disarm.
</p>
<p>His request was favourably received and the dwarf fashioned the spear Gungnir, which
never failed in its aim, and the ship Skidbladnir, which, always wafted by favourable
winds, could sail through the air as well as on the water, and which had this further
magic property, that although it could contain the gods and all their steeds, it could
be folded up into the very smallest compass and thrust in one’s pocket. Lastly, he
spun the finest golden thread, from which he fashioned the hair required for Sif,
declaring that as soon as it touched her head it would grow fast there and become
as her own.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Though they now seem dead, let them touch but her head,
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1327">Each hair shall the life-moisture fill;

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>The Dwarfs, Oehlenschläger (Pigott’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Loki was so pleased with these proofs of the dwarfs’ skill that he declared the son
of Ivald to be the most clever of smiths—words which were overheard by Brock, another
dwarf, who exclaimed that he was sure his brother Sindri could produce three objects
which would surpass those which Loki held, not only in intrinsic value, but also in
magical properties. Loki immediately challenged the dwarf to show his skill, wagering
his head against Brock’s on the result of the undertaking.
</p>
<p>Sindri, apprised of the wager, accepted Brock’s offer to blow the bellows, warning
him, however, that he must work persistently and not for a moment relax his efforts
if he wished him to succeed; then he threw some gold in the fire, and went out to
bespeak the favour of <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>the hidden powers. During his absence Brock diligently plied the bellows, while Loki,
hoping to make him pause, changed himself into a gadfly and cruelly stung his hand.
In spite of the pain, the dwarf kept on blowing, and when Sindri returned, he drew
out of the fire an enormous wild boar, called Gullin-bursti, because of its golden
bristles, which had the power of radiating light as it flitted across the sky, for
it could travel through the air with marvellous velocity.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And now, strange to tell, from the roaring fire

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>The Dwarfs, Oehlenschläger (Pigott’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>This first piece of work successfully completed, Sindri flung some more gold on the
fire and bade his brother resume blowing, while he again went out to secure magic
assistance. This time Loki, still disguised as a gadfly, stung the dwarf on his cheek;
but in spite of the pain Brock worked on, and when Sindri returned, he triumphantly
drew out of the flames the magic ring Draupnir, the emblem of fertility, from which
eight similar rings dropped every ninth night.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“They worked it and turned it with wondrous skill,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>The Dwarfs, Oehlenschläger (Pigott’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Now a lump of iron was cast in the flames, and with renewed caution not to forfeit
their success by inattention, Sindri passed out, leaving Brock to ply the bellows
as before. Loki was now in desperation and he prepared for a final effort. This time,
still in the guise of the gadfly, he stung the dwarf above the eye <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>until the blood began to flow in such a stream, that it prevented his seeing what
he was doing. Hastily raising his hand for a second, Brock dashed aside the stream
of blood; but short as was the interruption it had worked irreparable harm, and when
Sindri drew his work out of the fire he uttered an exclamation of disappointment for
the hammer he had fashioned was short in the handle.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then the dwarf raised his hand to his brow for the smart,
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1327">Ere the iron well out was beat,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>The Dwarfs, Oehlenschläger (Pigott’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this mishap, Brock was sure of winning the wager and he did not hesitate
to present himself before the gods in Asgard, where he gave Odin the ring Draupnir,
Frey the boar Gullin-bursti, and Thor the hammer Miölnir, whose power none could resist.
</p>
<p>Loki in turn gave the spear Gungnir to Odin, the ship Skidbladnir to Frey, and the
golden hair to Thor; but although the latter immediately grew upon Sif’s head and
was unanimously declared more beautiful than her own locks had ever been, the gods
decreed that Brock had won the wager, on the ground that the hammer Miölnir, in Thor’s
hands, would prove invaluable against the frost giants on the last day.
</p>

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>In order to save his head, Loki fled precipitately, but was overtaken by Thor, who
brought him back and handed him over to Brock, telling him, however, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>although Loki’s head was rightfully his, he must not touch his neck. Hindered from
obtaining full vengeance, the dwarf determined to punish Loki by sewing his lips together,
and as his sword would not pierce them, he borrowed his brother’s awl for the purpose.
However, Loki, after enduring the gods’ gibes in silence for a little while, managed
to cut the string and soon after was as loquacious as ever.
</p>
<p>In spite of his redoubtable hammer, Thor was not held in dread as the injurious god
of the storm, who destroyed peaceful homesteads and ruined the harvest by sudden hail-storms
and cloud-bursts. The Northmen fancied he hurled it only against ice giants and rocky
walls, reducing the latter to powder to fertilise the earth and make it yield plentiful
fruit to the tillers of the soil.
</p>
<p>In Germany, where the eastern storms are always cold and blighting, while the western
bring warm rains and mild weather, Thor was supposed to journey always from west to
east, to wage war against the evil spirits which would fain have enveloped the country
in impenetrable veils of mist and have bound it in icy fetters.

<h3 class="main">Thor’s Journey to Jötun-heim</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the giants from Jötun-heim were continually sending out cold blasts of wind to
nip the tender buds and hinder the growth of the flowers, Thor once made up his mind
to go and force them to behave better. Accompanied by Loki he set out in his chariot,
and after riding for a whole day the gods came at nightfall to the confines of the
giant-world, where, seeing a peasant’s hut, they resolved to stay for rest and refreshment.
</p>
<p>Their host was hospitable but very poor, and Thor, seeing that he would scarcely be
able to supply the <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>necessary food to satisfy his by no means small appetite, slew both his goats, which
he cooked and made ready to eat, inviting his host and family to partake freely of
the food thus provided, but cautioning them to throw all the bones, without breaking
them, into the skins of the goats which he had spread out on the floor.
</p>
<p>The peasant and his family ate heartily, but his son Thialfi, encouraged by mischievous
Loki, ventured to break one of the bones and suck out the marrow, thinking his disobedience
would not be detected. On the morrow, however, Thor, ready to depart, struck the goat
skins with his hammer Miölnir, and immediately the goats sprang up as lively as before,
except that one seemed somewhat lame. Perceiving that his commands had been disregarded,
Thor would have slain the whole family in his wrath. The culprit acknowledged his
fault, however, and the peasant offered to compensate for the loss by giving the irate
god not only his son Thialfi, but also his daughter Roskva, to serve him for ever.
</p>
<p>Charging the man to take good care of the goats, which he left there until he should
return, and bidding the young peasants accompany him, Thor now set out on foot with
Loki, and after walking all day found himself at nightfall in a bleak and barren country,
which was enveloped in an almost impenetrable grey mist. After seeking for some time,
Thor saw through the fog the uncertain outline of what looked like a strangely-shaped
house. Its open portal was so wide and high that it seemed to take up all one side
of the house. Entering and finding neither fire nor light, Thor and his companions
flung themselves wearily down on the floor to sleep, but were soon disturbed by a
peculiar noise, and a prolonged trembling of the ground beneath them. Fearing lest
the main roof <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>should fall during this earthquake, Thor and his companions took refuge in a wing
of the building, where they soon fell sound asleep. At dawn, the god and his companions
passed out, but they had not gone very far ere they saw the recumbent form of a sleeping
giant, and perceived that the peculiar sounds which had disturbed their rest were
produced by his snores. At that moment the giant awoke, arose, stretched himself,
looked about him for his missing property, and a second later picked up the object
which Thor and his companions had mistaken in the darkness for a house. They then
perceived with amazement that this was nothing more than a huge mitten, and that the
wing in which they had all slept was the separate place for the giant’s great thumb!
Learning that Thor and his companions were on their way to Utgard, as the giants’
realm was also called, Skrymir, the giant, proposed to be their guide; and after walking
with them all day, he brought them at nightfall to a spot where he proposed to rest.
Ere he composed himself for sleep, however, he offered them the provisions in his
wallet. But, in spite of strenuous efforts, neither Thor nor his companions could
unfasten the knots which Skrymir had tied.

<p class="first">Angry because of his snoring, which kept them awake, Thor thrice dealt him fearful
blows with his hammer. These strokes, instead of annihilating the monster, merely
evoked sleepy comments to the effect that a leaf, <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>a bit of bark, or a twig from a bird’s nest overhead had fallen upon his face. Early
on the morrow, Skrymir left Thor and his companions, pointing out the shortest road
to Utgard-loki’s castle, which was built of great ice blocks, with huge glittering
icicles as pillars. The gods, slipping between the bars of the great gate, presented
themselves boldly before the king of the giants, Utgard-loki, who, recognising them,
immediately pretended to be greatly surprised at their small size, and expressed a
wish to see for himself what they could do, as he had often heard their prowess vaunted.
</p>
<p>Loki, who had fasted longer than he wished, immediately declared he was ready to eat
for a wager with any one. So the king ordered a great wooden trough full of meat to
be brought into the hall, and placing Loki at one end and his cook Logi at the other,
he bade them see which would win. Although Loki did wonders, and soon reached the
middle of the trough, he found that, whereas he had picked the bones clean, his opponent
had devoured both them and the trough.
</p>
<p>Smiling contemptuously, Utgard-loki said that it was evident they could not do much
in the eating line, and this so nettled Thor that he declared if Loki could not eat
like the voracious cook, he felt confident he could drain the biggest vessel in the
house, such was his unquenchable thirst. Immediately a horn was brought in, and, Utgard-loki
declaring that good drinkers emptied it at one draught, moderately thirsty persons
at two, and small drinkers at three, Thor applied his lips to the rim. But, although
he drank so deep that he thought he would burst, the liquid still came almost up to
the rim when he raised his head. A second and third attempt to empty this horn proved
equally unsuccessful. Thialfi then offered to run a race, but a young fellow named
Hugi, who was matched <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>against him, soon outstripped him, although Thialfi ran remarkably fast.

<p>Thor proposed next to show his strength by lifting weights, and was challenged to
pick up the giant’s cat. Seizing an opportunity to tighten his belt Megin-giörd, which
greatly enhanced his strength, he tugged and strained but was able only to raise one
of its paws from the floor.

</p>
<p>A last attempt on his part to wrestle with Utgard-loki’s old nurse Elli, the only
opponent deemed worthy of such a puny fellow, ended just as disastrously, and the
gods, acknowledging they were beaten, were hospitably entertained. On the morrow they
were escorted to the confines of Utgard, where the giant politely informed them that
he hoped they would never call upon him again, as he had been forced to employ magic
against them. He then went on to explain that he was the giant Skrymir, and that had
he not taken the precaution to interpose a mountain between his head and Thor’s blows,
while he seemingly lay asleep, he would have been slain, as deep clefts in the mountain
side, to which he pointed, testified to the god’s strength. Next he informed them
that Loki’s opponent was Logi (wild fire); that Thialfi had run a race with Hugi (thought),
than which no swifter runner exists; that Thor’s drinking horn was connected with
the ocean, where his deep draughts had produced a perceptible ebb; that the cat was
in reality the terrible Midgard snake encircling the world, which Thor had nearly
pulled out of the sea; and that Elli, his nurse, was old age, whom none can resist.
Having finished these <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>explanations and cautioned them never to return or he would defend himself by similar
delusions, Utgard-loki vanished, and although Thor angrily brandished his hammer,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Odin himself was once dashing through the air on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir,
when he attracted the attention of the giant Hrungnir, who proposed a race, declaring
that Gullfaxi, his steed, could rival Sleipnir in speed. In the heat of the race,
Hrungnir did not notice the direction in which they were going, until, in the vain
hope of overtaking Odin, he urged his steed to the very gates of Valhalla. Discovering
then where he was, the giant grew pale with fear, for he knew he had jeopardised his
life by venturing into the stronghold of the gods, his hereditary foes.
</p>
<p>The Æsir, however, were too honourable to take even an enemy at a disadvantage, and,
instead of doing him harm, they asked him into their banqueting-halls, where he proceeded
to indulge in liberal potations of the heavenly mead set before him. He soon grew
so excited that he began to boast of his power, declaring he would come some day and
take possession of Asgard, which he would destroy, together with the gods, save <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>only Freya and Sif, upon whom he gazed with an admiring leer.
</p>
<p>The gods, knowing he was not responsible, let him talk unmolested; but Thor, coming
home just then from one of his journeys, and hearing his threat to carry away the
beloved Sif, flew into a terrible rage. He furiously brandished his hammer, with intent
to annihilate the boaster. This the gods would not permit, however, and they quickly
threw themselves between the irate Thunderer and their guest, imploring Thor to respect
the sacred rights of hospitality, and not to desecrate their peace-stead by shedding
blood.
</p>
<p>Thor was at last induced to bridle his wrath, but he demanded that Hrungnir should
appoint a time and place for a holmgang, as a Northern duel was generally called.
Thus challenged, Hrungnir promised to meet Thor at Griottunagard, the confines of
his realm, three days later, and departed somewhat sobered by the fright he had experienced.
When his fellow giants heard how rash he had been, they chided him sorely; but they
took counsel together in order to make the best of a bad situation. Hrungnir told
them that he was to have the privilege of being accompanied by a squire, whom Thialfi
would engage in fight, wherefore they proceeded to construct a creature of clay, nine
miles long, and proportionately wide, whom they called Mokerkialfi (mist wader). As
they could find no human heart big enough to put in this monster’s breast, they secured
that of a mare, which, however, kept fluttering and quivering with apprehension. The
day of the duel arrived. Hrungnir and his squire were on the ground awaiting the arrival
of their respective opponents. The giant had not only a flint heart and skull, but
also a shield and club of the same substance, and therefore deemed himself well-nigh
invincible. Thialfi came before his <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>master and soon after there was a terrible rumbling and shaking which made the giant
apprehensive that his enemy would come up through the ground and attack him from underneath.
He therefore followed a hint from Thialfi and stood upon his shield.
</p>
<p>A moment later, however, he saw his mistake, for, while Thialfi attacked Mokerkialfi
with a spade, Thor came with a rush upon the scene and flung his hammer full at his
opponent’s head. Hrungnir, to ward off the blow, interposed his stone club, which
was shivered into pieces that flew all over the earth, supplying all the flint stones
thereafter to be found, and one fragment sank deep into Thor’s forehead. As the god
dropped fainting to the ground, his hammer crashed against the head of Hrungnir, who
fell dead beside him, in such a position that one of his ponderous legs was thrown
over the recumbent god.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Thou now remindest me

<p>Thialfi, who, in the meanwhile, had disposed of the great clay giant with its cowardly
mare’s heart, now rushed to his master’s assistance, but his efforts were unavailing,
nor could the other gods, whom he quickly summoned, raise the pinioning leg. While
they were standing there, helplessly wondering what they should do next, Thor’s little
son Magni came up. According to varying accounts, he was then only three days or three
years old, but he quickly seized the giant’s foot, and, unaided, set his father free,
declaring that had he only been summoned sooner he would easily have <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>disposed of both giant and squire. This exhibition of strength made the gods marvel
greatly, and helped them to recognise the truth of the various predictions, which
one and all declared that their descendants would be mightier than they, would survive
them, and would rule in their turn over the new heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>To reward his son for his timely aid, Thor gave him the steed Gullfaxi (golden-maned),
to which he had fallen heir by right of conquest, and Magni ever after rode this marvellous
horse, which almost equalled the renowned Sleipnir in speed and endurance.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After vainly trying to remove the stone splinter from his forehead, Thor sadly returned
home to Thrud-vang, where Sif’s loving efforts were equally unsuccessful. She therefore
resolved to send for Groa (green-making), a sorceress, noted for her skill in medicine
and for the efficacy of her spells and incantations. Groa immediately signified her
readiness to render every service in her power to the god who had so often benefited
her, and solemnly began to recite powerful runes, under whose influence Thor felt
the stone grow looser and looser. His delight at the prospect of a speedy deliverance
made Thor wish to reward the enchantress forthwith, and knowing that nothing could
give greater pleasure to a mother than the prospect of seeing a long-lost child, he
proceeded to tell her that he had recently crossed the Elivagar, or ice streams, to
rescue her little son Orvandil (germ) from the frost giants’ cruel power, and had
succeeded in carrying him off in a basket. But, as the little rogue would persist
in sticking one of his bare toes through a hole in the basket, it had been frost-bitten,
and Thor, accidentally breaking it off, had <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>flung it up into the sky, to shine as a star, known in the North as “Orvandil’s Toe.”
</p>
<p>Delighted with these tidings, the prophetess paused in her incantations to express
her joy, but, having forgotten just where she left off, she was unable to continue
her spell, and the flint stone remained embedded in Thor’s forehead, whence it could
never be dislodged.
</p>
<p>Of course, as Thor’s hammer always did him such good service, it was the most prized
of all his possessions, and his dismay was very great when he awoke one morning and
found it gone. His cry of anger and disappointment soon brought Loki to his side,
and to him Thor confided the secret of his loss, declaring that were the giants to
hear of it, they would soon attempt to storm Asgard and destroy the gods.

would lend him her falcon plumes, and he immediately hastened off to Folkvang to borrow
them. His errand was successful and in the form of a bird he then winged his flight
across the river Ifing, and over the barren stretches of Jötun-heim, where he suspected
that the thief would be found. There he saw Thrym, prince of the frost giants and
god of the destructive thunder-storm, sitting <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>alone on a hill-side. Artfully questioning him, he soon learned that Thrym had stolen

<p>Indignant at the giant’s presumption, Loki returned to Thrud-vang, but Thor declared
it would be well to visit Freya and try to prevail upon her to sacrifice herself for
the general good. But when the Æsir told the goddess of beauty what they wished her
to do, she flew into such a passion that even her necklace burst. She told them that
she would never leave her beloved husband for any god, much less to marry a detested
giant and dwell in Jötun-heim, where all was dreary in the extreme, and where she
would soon die of longing for the green fields and flowery meadows, in which she loved
to roam. Seeing that further persuasions would be useless, Loki and Thor returned
home and there deliberated upon another plan for recovering the hammer. By Heimdall’s
advice, which, however, was only accepted with extreme reluctance, Thor borrowed and
put on Freya’s clothes together with her necklace, and enveloped himself in a thick
veil. Loki, having attired himself as handmaiden, then mounted with him in the goat-drawn
chariot, and the strangely attired pair set out for Jötun-heim, where they intended
to play the respective parts of the goddess of beauty and her attendant.

<p>Thrym welcomed his guests at the palace door, overjoyed at the thought that he was
about to secure undisputed possession of the goddess of beauty, for whom he had long
sighed in vain. He quickly led them to the banqueting-hall, where Thor, the bride
elect, distinguished himself by eating an ox, eight huge salmon, and all the cakes
and sweets provided for the women, washing down these miscellaneous viands with the
contents of two barrels of mead.
</p>
<p>The giant bridegroom watched these gastronomic feats with amazement, whereupon Loki,
in order to reassure him, confidentially whispered that the bride was so deeply in
love with him that she had not been able to taste a morsel of food for more than eight
days. Thrym then sought to kiss the bride, but drew back appalled at the fire of her
glance, which Loki explained as a burning glance of love. The giant’s sister, claiming
the usual gifts, was not even noticed; wherefore Loki again whispered to the wondering
Thrym that love makes people absent-minded. Intoxicated with passion and mead, which
he, too, had drunk in liberal quantities, the bridegroom now bade his servants produce
the sacred hammer to consecrate the marriage, and as soon as it was brought he himself
laid it in the pretended Freya’s lap. The next moment a powerful hand closed over
the short handle, and soon the giant, his sister, <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>and all the invited guests, were slain by the terrible Thor.

<p>Leaving a smoking heap of ruins behind them, the gods then drove rapidly back to Asgard,

and the Æsir rejoiced at the recovery of the precious hammer. When next Odin gazed
upon that part of Jötun-heim from his throne Hlidskialf, he saw the ruins covered
with tender green shoots, for Thor, having conquered his enemy, had taken possession
of his land, which henceforth would no longer remain barren and desolate, but would

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Loki once borrowed Freya’s falcon-garb and flew off in search of adventures to another
part of Jötun-heim, where he perched on top of the gables of Geirrod’s house. He soon
attracted the attention of this giant, who bade one of his servants catch the bird.
Amused at the fellow’s clumsy attempts to secure him, Loki flitted about from place
to place, only moving just as the giant was about to lay hands upon him, when, miscalculating
his distance, he suddenly found himself a captive.
</p>
<p>Attracted by the bird’s bright eyes, Geirrod looked closely at it and concluded that
it was a god in disguise, <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>and finding that he could not force him to speak, he locked him in a cage, where he
kept him for three whole months without food or drink. Conquered at last by hunger
and thirst, Loki revealed his identity, and obtained his release by promising that
he would induce Thor to visit Geirrod without his hammer, belt, or magic gauntlet.
Loki then flew back to Asgard, and told Thor that he had been royally entertained,
and that his host had expressed a strong desire to see the powerful thunder-god, of
whom he had heard such wonderful tales. Flattered by this artful speech, Thor was
induced to consent to a friendly journey to Jötun-heim, and the two gods set out,
leaving the three marvellous weapons at home. They had not gone far, however, ere
they came to the house of the giantess Grid, one of Odin’s many wives. Seeing Thor
unarmed, she warned him to beware of treachery and lent him her own girdle, staff,
and glove. Some time after leaving her, Thor and Loki came to the river Veimer, which
the Thunderer, accustomed to wading, prepared to ford, bidding Loki and Thialfi cling
fast to his belt.
</p>
<p>In the middle of the stream, however, a sudden cloud-burst and freshet overtook them;
the waters began to rise and roar, and although Thor leaned heavily upon his staff,
he was almost swept away by the force of the raging current.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Wax not, Veimer,

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Norse Mythology (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
</p>
<p>Thor now became aware of the presence, up stream, of Geirrod’s daughter Gialp, and
rightly suspecting that <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>she was the cause of the storm, he picked up a huge boulder and flung it at her, muttering
that the best place to dam a river was at its source. The missile had the desired
effect, for the giantess fled, the waters abated, and Thor, exhausted but safe, pulled
himself up on the opposite bank by a little shrub, the mountain-ash or sorb. This
has since been known as “Thor’s salvation,” and occult powers have been attributed
to it. After resting awhile Thor and his companions resumed their journey; but upon
arriving at Geirrod’s house the god was so exhausted that he sank wearily upon the
only chair in sight. To his surprise, however, he felt it rising beneath him, and
fearful lest he should be crushed against the rafters, he pushed the borrowed staff
against the ceiling and forced the chair downward with all his might. Then followed
a terrible cracking, sudden cries, and moans of pain; and when Thor came to investigate,
it appeared that the giant’s daughters, Gialp and Greip, had slipped under his chair
with intent treacherously to slay him, and they had reaped a righteous retribution
and both lay crushed to death.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p>Geirrod now appeared and challenged Thor to a test of strength and skill, but without
waiting for a preconcerted signal, he flung a red-hot wedge at him. Thor, quick of
eye and a practised catcher, caught the missile with the giantess’s iron glove, and
hurled it back at his opponent. Such was the force of the god, that the missile passed,
not only through the pillar behind which the giant had taken refuge, but through him
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>the wall of the house, and buried itself deep in the earth without.
</p>
<p>Thor then strode up to the giant’s corpse, which at the blow from his weapon had been
petrified into stone, and set it up in a conspicuous place, as a monument of his strength
and of the victory he had won over his redoubtable foes, the mountain giants.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thor’s name has been given to many of the places he was wont to frequent, such as
the principal harbour of the Faroe Islands, and to families which claim to be descended
from him. It is still extant in such names as Thunderhill in Surrey, and in the family
names of Thorburn and Thorwaldsen, but is most conspicuous in the name of one of the
days of the week, Thor’s day or Thursday.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">Still is it Thor’s day!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Saga of King Olaf (Longfellow).</i>
</p>
<p>Thor was considered a pre-eminently benevolent deity, and it was for that reason that
he was so widely worshipped and that temples to his worship arose at Moeri, Hlader,
Godey, Gothland, Upsala, and other places, where the people never failed to invoke
him for a favourable year at Yule-tide, his principal festival. It was customary on
this occasion to burn a great log of oak, his sacred tree, as an emblem of the warmth
and light of summer, which would drive away the darkness and cold of winter.
</p>
<p>Brides invariably wore red, Thor’s favourite colour, which was considered emblematical
of love, and for the same reason betrothal rings in the North were almost always set
with a red stone.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thor’s temples and statues, like Odin’s, were fashioned of wood, and the greater number
of them were destroyed during the reign of King Olaf the Saint. According to ancient
chronicles, this monarch forcibly converted his subjects. He was specially incensed
against the inhabitants of a certain province, because they worshipped a rude image
of Thor, which they decked with golden ornaments, and before which they set food every
evening, declaring the god ate it, as no trace of it was left in the morning.
</p>
<p>The people, being called upon in 1030 to renounce this idol in favour of the true
God, promised to consent if the morrow were cloudy; but when after a whole night spent
by Olaf in ardent prayer, there followed a cloudy day, the obstinate people declared
they were not yet convinced of his God’s power, and would only believe if the sun
shone on the next day.
</p>
<p>Once more Olaf spent the night in prayer, but at dawn, to his great chagrin, the sky
was overcast. Nevertheless, he assembled the people near Thor’s statue, and after
secretly bidding his principal attendant to smash the idol with his battle-axe if
the people turned their eyes away but for a moment, he began to address them. Suddenly,
while all were listening to him, Olaf pointed to the horizon, where the sun was slowly
breaking its way through the clouds, and exclaimed, “Behold our God!” The people one
and all turned to see what he meant, and the attendant seized this opportunity for
attacking the idol, which yielded easily to his blows, and a host of mice and other
vermin scattered hastily from its hollow interior. Seeing now that the food placed
before their god had been devoured by noxious animals only, the people ceased to revere
Thor, and definitely accepted the faith which King Olaf had so long and vainly pressed
upon them.

<p class="first">Tyr Tiu, or Ziu was the son of Odin, and, according to different mythologists, his
mother was Frigga, queen of the gods, or a beautiful giantess whose name is unknown,
but who was a personification of the raging sea. He is the god of martial honour,
and one of the twelve principal deities of Asgard. Although he appears to have had
no special dwelling there, he was always welcome to Vingolf or Valhalla, and occupied
one of the twelve thrones in the great council hall of Glads-heim.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>As the God of courage and of war, Tyr was frequently invoked by the various nations
of the North, who cried to him, as well as to Odin, to obtain victory. That he ranked
next to Odin and Thor is proved by his name, Tiu, having been given to one of the
days of the week, Tiu’s day, which in modern English has become Tuesday. Under the
name of Ziu, Tyr was the principal divinity of the Suabians, who originally called
their capital, the modern Augsburg, Ziusburg. This people, venerating the god as they
did, were wont to worship him under the emblem of a sword, his distinctive attribute,
and in his honour held great sword dances, where various figures were performed. Sometimes
the participants forming two long lines, crossed their swords, point upward, and challenged
the boldest among their number to take a flying leap over them. At other times the
warriors joined their sword points closely <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>together in the shape of a rose or wheel, and when this figure was complete invited
their chief to stand on the navel thus formed of flat, shining steel blades, and then
they bore him upon it through the camp in triumph. The sword point was further considered
so sacred that it became customary to register oaths upon it.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“… Come hither, gentlemen,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Hamlet (Shakespeare).</i>
</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of the worship of this god among the Franks and some other Northern
nations was that the priests called Druids or Godi offered up human sacrifices upon
his altars, generally cutting the bloody- or spread-eagle upon their victims, that
is to say, making a deep incision on either side of the back-bone, turning the ribs
thus loosened inside out, and tearing out the viscera through the opening thus made.
Of course only prisoners of war were treated thus, and it was considered a point of
honour with north European races to endure this torture without a moan. These sacrifices
were made upon rude stone altars called dolmens, which can still be seen in Northern
Europe. As Tyr was considered the patron god of the sword, it was deemed indispensable
to engrave the sign or rune representing him upon the blade of every sword—an observance
which the Edda enjoined upon all those who were desirous of obtaining victory.

<p class="first">According to an ancient legend, Cheru’s sword, which had been fashioned by the same
dwarfs, sons of Ivald, who had also made Odin’s spear, was held very sacred by his
people, to whose care he had entrusted it, declaring that those who possessed it were
sure to have the victory over their foes. But although carefully guarded in the temple,
where it was hung so that it reflected the first beams of the morning sun, it suddenly
and mysteriously disappeared one night. A Vala, druidess, or prophetess, consulted
by the priests, revealed that the Norns had decreed that whoever wielded it would
conquer the world and come to his death by it; but in spite of all entreaties she
refused to tell who had taken it or where it might be found. Some time after this
occurrence a tall and dignified stranger came to Cologne, where Vitellius, the Roman
prefect, was feasting, and called him away from his beloved dainties. In the presence
of the Roman soldiery he gave him the sword, telling him it would bring him glory
and renown, and finally hailed him as emperor. The cry was taken up by the assembled
legions, and Vitellius, without making any personal effort to secure the honour, found
himself elected Emperor of Rome.
</p>
<p>The new ruler, however, was so absorbed in indulging <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>his taste for food and drink that he paid but little heed to the divine weapon. One
day while leisurely making his way towards Rome he carelessly left it hanging in the
antechamber to his pavilion. A German soldier seized this opportunity to substitute
in its stead his own rusty blade, and the besotted emperor did not notice the exchange.
When he arrived at Rome, he learned that the Eastern legions had named Vespasian emperor,
and that he was even then on his way home to claim the throne.

<p>Searching for the sacred weapon to defend his rights, Vitellius now discovered the
theft, and, overcome by superstitious fears, did not even attempt to fight. He crawled
away into a dark corner of his palace, whence he was ignominiously dragged by the
enraged populace to the foot of the Capitoline Hill. There the prophecy was duly fulfilled,
for the German soldier, who had joined the opposite faction, coming along at that
moment, cut off Vitellius’ head with the sacred sword.
</p>
<p>The German soldier now changed from one legion to another, and travelled over many
lands; but wherever he and his sword were found, victory was assured. After winning
great honour and distinction, this man, having grown old, retired from active service
to the banks of the Danube, where he secretly buried his treasured weapon, building
his hut over its resting-place to guard it as long as he might live. When he lay on
his deathbed he was implored to reveal where he had hidden it, but he persistently
refused to do so, saying that it would be found by the man who was destined to conquer
the world, but that he would not be able to escape the curse. Years passed by. Wave
after wave the tide of barbarian invasion swept over that part of the country, and
last of all came the terrible Huns under the leadership of Attila, the “Scourge of
God.” As he passed <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>along the river, he saw a peasant mournfully examining his cow’s foot, which had been
wounded by some sharp instrument hidden in the long grass, and when search was made
the point of a buried sword was found sticking out of the soil.
</p>
<p>Attila, seeing the beautiful workmanship and the fine state of preservation of this
weapon, immediately exclaimed that it was Cheru’s sword, and brandishing it above
his head he announced that he would conquer the world. Battle after battle was fought
by the Huns, who, according to the Saga, were everywhere victorious, until Attila,
weary of warfare, settled down in Hungary, taking to wife the beautiful Burgundian
princess Ildico, whose father he had slain. This princess, resenting the murder of
her kin and wishing to avenge it, took advantage of the king’s state of intoxication
upon his wedding night to secure possession of the divine sword, with which she slew
him in his bed, once more fulfilling the prophecy uttered so many years before.
</p>
<p>The magic sword again disappeared for a long time, to be unearthed once more, for
the last time, by the Duke of Alva, Charles V.’s general, who shortly after won the
victory of Mühlberg (1547). The Franks were wont to celebrate yearly martial games
in honour of the sword; but it is said that when the heathen gods were renounced in
favour of Christianity, the priests transferred many of their attributes to the saints,
and that this sword became the property of the Archangel St. Michael, who has wielded
it ever since.
</p>
<p>Tyr, whose name was synonymous with bravery and wisdom, was also considered by the
ancient Northern people to have the white-armed Valkyrs, Odin’s attendants, at his
command, and they thought that he it was who designated the warriors whom they should
transfer to Valhalla to aid the gods on the last day.

<h3 class="main">The Story of Fenris</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tyr was generally spoken of and represented as one-armed, just as Odin was called
one-eyed. Various explanations are offered by different authorities; some claim that
it was because he could give the victory only to one side; others, because a sword
has but one blade. However this may be, the ancients preferred to account for the
fact in the following way:
</p>
<p>Loki married secretly at Jötun-heim the hideous giantess Angur-boda (anguish boding),
who bore him three monstrous children—the wolf Fenris, Hel, the parti-coloured goddess
of death, and Iörmungandr, a terrible serpent. He kept the existence of these monsters
secret as long as he could; but they speedily grew so large that they could no longer
remain confined in the cave where they had come to light. Odin, from his throne Hlidskialf,
soon became aware of their existence, and also of the disquieting rapidity with which
they increased in size. Fearful lest the monsters, when they had gained further strength,
should invade Asgard and destroy the gods, Allfather determined to get rid of them,
and striding off to Jötun-heim, he flung Hel into the depths of Nifl-heim, telling
her she could reign over the nine dismal worlds of the dead. He then cast Iörmungandr
into the sea, where he attained such immense proportions that at last he encircled
the earth and could bite his own tail.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Into mid-ocean’s dark depths hurled,
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1327">Grown with each day to giant size,

<p class="line xd32e1327">With tail in mouth, in circle-wise;
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1583">Held harmless still
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1583">By Odin’s will.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Valhalla (J.&nbsp;C. Jones).</i>
</p>
<p>None too well pleased that the serpent should attain such fearful dimensions in his
new element, Odin resolved to lead Fenris to Asgard, where he hoped, by kindly treatment,
to make him gentle and tractable. But the gods one and all shrank in dismay when they
saw the wolf, and none dared approach to give him food except Tyr, whom nothing daunted.
Seeing that Fenris daily increased in size, strength, voracity, and fierceness, the
gods assembled in council to deliberate how they might best dispose of him. They unanimously
decided that as it would desecrate their peace-steads to slay him, they would bind
him fast so that he could work them no harm.
</p>
<p>With that purpose in view, they obtained a strong chain named Læding, and then playfully
proposed to Fenris to bind this about him as a test of his vaunted strength. Confident
in his ability to release himself, Fenris patiently allowed them to bind him fast,
and when all stood aside, with a mighty effort he stretched himself and easily burst
the chain asunder.
</p>
<p>Concealing their chagrin, the gods were loud in praise of his strength, but they next
produced a much stronger fetter, Droma, which, after some persuasion, the wolf allowed
them to fasten around him as before. Again a short, sharp struggle sufficed to burst
this bond, and it is proverbial in the North to use the figurative expressions, “to
get loose out of Læding,” and “to dash out of Droma,” whenever great difficulties
have to be surmounted.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Twice did the Æsir strive to bind,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Valhalla (J.&nbsp;C. Jones).</i>
</p>
<p>The gods, perceiving now that ordinary bonds, however strong, would never prevail
against the Fenris wolf’s great strength, bade Skirnir, Frey’s servant, go down to
Svart-alfa-heim and bid the dwarfs fashion a bond which nothing could sever.

<p>By magic arts the dark elves manufactured a slender silken rope from such impalpable
materials as the sound of a cat’s footsteps, a woman’s beard, the roots of a mountain,
the longings of the bear, the voice of fishes, and the spittle of birds, and when
it was finished they gave it to Skirnir, assuring him that no strength would avail
to break it, and that the more it was strained the stronger it would become.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Valhalla (J.&nbsp;C. Jones).</i>
</p>
<p>Armed with this bond, called Gleipnir, the gods went with Fenris to the Island of
Lyngvi, in the middle of Lake Amsvartnir, and again proposed to test his strength.
But although Fenris had grown still stronger, he mistrusted the bond which looked
so slight. He therefore refused to allow himself to be bound, unless one of the Æsir
would consent to put his hand in his mouth, and leave it there, as a pledge of good
faith, and that no magic arts were to be used against him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gods heard the decision with dismay, and all drew back except Tyr, who, seeing
that the others would not venture to comply with this condition, boldly stepped forward
and thrust his hand between the monster’s jaws. The gods now fastened Gleipnir securely
around Fenris’s neck and paws, and when they saw that his utmost efforts to free himself
were fruitless, they shouted and laughed with glee. Tyr, however, could not share
their joy, for the wolf, finding himself captive, bit off the god’s hand at the wrist,
which since then has been known as the wolf’s joint.

</p>
<p>Deprived of his right hand, Tyr was now forced to use the maimed arm for his shield,
and to wield his sword with his left hand; but such was his dexterity that he slew
his enemies as before.
</p>
<p>The gods, in spite of the wolf’s struggles, drew the end of the fetter Gelgia through
the rock Gioll, and fastened it to the boulder Thviti, which was sunk deep in the
ground. Opening wide his fearful jaws, Fenris uttered such terrible howls that the
gods, to silence <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>him, thrust a sword into his mouth, the hilt resting upon his lower jaw and the point
against his palate. The blood then began to pour out in such streams that it formed
a great river, called Von. The wolf was destined to remain thus chained fast until
the last day, when he would burst his bonds and would be free to avenge his wrongs.

can injure no one, but which unfettered fills the world with destruction and woe.
Just as Odin’s second eye is said to rest in Mimir’s well, so Tyr’s second hand (sword)
is found in Fenris’s jaws. He has no more use for two weapons than the sky for two
suns.
</p>
<p>The worship of Tyr is commemorated in sundry places (such as Tübingen, in Germany),
which bear more or less modified forms of his name. The name has also been given to
the aconite, a plant known in Northern countries as “Tyr’s helm.”

<h3 class="main">The Origin of Poetry</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the time of the dispute between the Æsir and Vanas, when peace had been agreed
upon, a vase was brought into the assembly into which both parties solemnly spat.
From this saliva the gods created Kvasir, a being renowned for his wisdom and goodness,
who went about the world answering all questions asked him, thus teaching and benefiting
mankind. The dwarfs, hearing about Kvasir’s great wisdom, coveted it, and finding
him asleep one day, two of their number, Fialar and Galar, treacherously slew him,
and drained every drop of his blood into three vessels—the kettle Od-hroerir (inspiration)
and the bowls Son (expiation) and Boden (offering). After duly mixing this blood with
honey, they manufactured from it a sort of beverage so inspiring that any one who
tasted it immediately became a poet, and could sing with a charm which was certain
to win all hearts.
</p>
<p>Now, although the dwarfs had brewed this marvellous mead for their own consumption,
they did not even taste it, but hid it away in a secret place, while they went in
search of further adventures. They had not gone very far ere they found the giant
Gilling also sound asleep, lying on a steep bank, and they maliciously rolled him
into the water, where he perished. Then hastening to his dwelling, some climbed on
the roof, carrying a huge millstone, while the others, entering, told the giantess
that her husband was dead. This news caused the poor creature great grief, and she
rushed out of the house to view Gilling’s remains. As she passed through the door,
the wicked dwarfs rolled the millstone down upon her head, and killed her. According
to another account, the dwarfs invited the <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>giant to go fishing with them, and succeeded in slaying him by sending him out in
a leaky vessel, which sank beneath his weight.
</p>
<p>The double crime thus committed did not long remain unpunished, for Gilling’s brother,
Suttung, quickly went in search of the dwarfs, determined to avenge him. Seizing them
in his mighty grasp, the giant conveyed them to a shoal far out at sea, where they
would surely have perished at the next high tide had they not succeeded in redeeming
their lives by promising to deliver to the giant their recently brewed mead. As soon
as Suttung set them ashore, they therefore gave him the precious compound, which he
entrusted to his daughter Gunlod, bidding her guard it night and day, and allow neither
gods nor mortals to have so much as a taste. The better to fulfil this command, Gunlod
carried the three vessels into the hollow mountain, where she kept watch over them
with the most scrupulous care, nor did she suspect that Odin had discovered their
place of concealment, thanks to the sharp eyes of his ever-vigilant ravens Hugin and
Munin.

<h3 class="main">The Quest of the Draught</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As Odin had mastered the runic lore and had tasted the waters of Mimir’s fountain,
he was already the wisest of gods; but learning of the power of the draught of inspiration
manufactured out of Kvasir’s blood, he became very anxious to obtain possession of
the magic fluid. With this purpose in view he therefore donned his broad-brimmed hat,
wrapped himself in his cloud-hued cloak, and journeyed off to Jötun-heim. On his way
to the giant’s dwelling he passed by a field where nine ugly thralls were busy making
hay. Odin paused for a moment, watching them at their work, and noticing that their
scythes seemed very dull indeed, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>proposed to whet them, an offer which the thralls eagerly accepted.
</p>
<p>Drawing a whetstone from his bosom, Odin proceeded to sharpen the nine scythes, skilfully
giving them such a keen edge that the thralls, delighted, begged that they might have
the stone. With good-humoured acquiescence, Odin tossed the whetstone over the wall;
but as the nine thralls simultaneously sprang forward to catch it, they wounded one
another with their keen scythes. In anger at their respective carelessness, they now
began to fight, and did not pause until they were all either mortally wounded or dead.
</p>
<p>Quite undismayed by this tragedy, Odin continued on his way, and shortly after came
to the house of the giant Baugi, a brother of Suttung, who received him very hospitably.
In the course of conversation, Baugi informed him that he was greatly embarrassed,
as it was harvest time and all his workmen had just been found dead in the hayfield.
</p>
<p>Odin, who on this occasion had given his name as Bolwerk (evil doer), promptly offered
his services to the giant, promising to accomplish as much work as the nine thralls,
and to labour diligently all the summer in exchange for one single draught of Suttung’s
magic mead when the busy season was ended. This bargain was immediately concluded,
and Baugi’s new servant, Bolwerk, worked incessantly all the summer long, more than
fulfilling his contract, and safely garnering all the grain before the autumn rains
began to fall. When the first days of winter came, Bolwerk presented himself before
his master, claiming his reward. But Baugi hesitated and demurred, saying he dared
not openly ask his brother Suttung for the draught of inspiration, but would try to
obtain it by guile. Together, Bolwerk and Baugi then proceeded to the mountain where
<span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>Gunlod dwelt, and as they could find no other mode of entering the secret cave, Odin
produced his trusty auger, called Rati, and bade the giant bore with all his might
to make a hole through which he might crawl into the interior.
</p>
<p>Baugi silently obeyed, and after a few moments’ work withdrew the tool, saying that
he had pierced through the mountain, and that Odin would have no difficulty in slipping
through. But the god, mistrusting this statement, merely blew into the hole, and when
the dust and chips came flying into his face, he sternly bade Baugi resume his boring
and not attempt to deceive him again. The giant did as he was told, and when he withdrew
his tool again, Odin ascertained that the hole was really finished. Changing himself
into a snake, he wriggled through with such remarkable rapidity that he managed to
elude the sharp auger, which Baugi treacherously thrust into the hole after him, intending
to kill him.

<p class="first">Having reached the interior of the mountain, Odin reassumed his usual godlike form
and starry mantle, and then presented himself in the stalactite-hung cave before the
beautiful Gunlod. He intended to win her love as a means of inducing her to grant
him a sip from each of the vessels confided to her care.
</p>
<p>Won by his passionate wooing, Gunlod consented to become his wife, and after he had
spent three whole days with her in this retreat, she brought out the vessels <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>from their secret hiding-place, and told him he might take a sip from each.

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Odin’s Rune-Song (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Odin made good use of this permission and drank so deeply that he completely drained
all three vessels. Then, having obtained all that he wanted, he emerged from the cave
and, donning his eagle plumes, rose high into the blue, and, after hovering for a
moment over the mountain top, winged his flight towards Asgard.
</p>
<p>He was still far from the gods’ realm when he became aware of a pursuer, and, indeed,
Suttung, having also assumed the form of an eagle, was coming rapidly after him with
intent to compel him to surrender the stolen mead. Odin therefore flew faster and
faster, straining every nerve to reach Asgard before the foe should overtake him,
and as he drew near the gods anxiously watched the race.
</p>
<p>Seeing that Odin would only with difficulty be able to escape, the Æsir hastily gathered
all the combustible materials they could find, and as he flew over the ramparts of
their dwelling, they set fire to the mass <span class="corr" id="xd32e2883" title="Source: or">of</span> fuel, so that the flames, rising high, singed the wings of Suttung, as he followed
the god, and he fell into the very midst of the fire, where he was burned to death.
</p>
<p>As for Odin, he flew to where the gods had prepared vessels for the stolen mead, and
disgorged the draught of inspiration in such breathless haste that a few drops fell
and were scattered over the earth. There they became the portion of rhymesters and
poetasters, the gods reserving the main draught for their own consumption, and only
occasionally vouchsafing a taste to <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>some favoured mortal, who, immediately after, would win world-wide renown by his inspired

on one of their own vessels, they sent him out into the wide world. As the boat gently
passed out of subterranean darkness, and floated over the threshold of Nain, the realm
of the dwarf of death, Bragi, the fair and immaculate young god, who until then had
shown no signs of life, suddenly sat up, and, seizing the golden harp beside him,
he began to sing the <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>wondrous song of life, which rose at times to heaven, and then sank down to the dread

bud and bloom, and the grass underfoot was gemmed with countless flowers.

<p>Here he met Idun, daughter of Ivald, the fair goddess of immortal youth, whom the
dwarfs allowed to visit the earth from time to time, when, at her approach, nature
invariably assumed its loveliest and gentlest aspect.

<p>It was only to be expected that two such beings should feel attracted to each other,
and Bragi soon won this fair goddess for his wife. Together they hastened to Asgard,

destitute of honour. Following his example, all the guests were then wont to make
similar vows and declare what they would do; and as some of them, owing to previous
potations, talked rather too freely of their intentions on these occasions, this custom
seems to connect the god’s name with the vulgar but very expressive English verb “to
brag.”

<p>In art, Bragi is generally represented as an elderly man, with long white hair and
beard, and holding the golden harp from which his fingers could draw such magic strains.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Idun, the personification of spring or immortal youth, who, according to some mythologists,
had no birth and was never to taste death, was warmly welcomed by the gods when she
made her appearance in Asgard with Bragi. To further win their affections she promised
them a daily taste of the marvellous apples which she bore in her casket, and which
had the power of conferring immortal youth and loveliness upon all who partook of
them.
</p>

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Wagner (Forman’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Thanks to this magic fruit, the Scandinavian gods, who, because they sprang from a
mixed race, were not all immortal, warded off the approach of old age and disease,
and remained vigorous, beautiful, and young through countless ages. These apples were
therefore considered very precious indeed, and Idun carefully treasured them in her
magic casket. No matter how many she drew out, the same number always remained for
distribution at the feast of the gods, to whom alone she vouchsafed a taste, although
dwarfs and giants were eager to obtain possession of the fruit.

<h3 class="main">The Story of Thiassi</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day, Odin, Hoenir, and Loki started out upon one of their usual excursions to
earth, and, after wandering for a long while, they found themselves in a deserted
region, where they could discover no hospitable dwelling. Weary and very hungry, the
gods, perceiving a herd of oxen, slew one of the beasts, and, kindling a fire, they
sat down beside it to rest while waiting for their meat to cook.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p104width" id="p104"><img src="images/p104.jpg" alt="Loki and Thiassi" width="504" height="720"><p class="figureHead">Loki and Thiassi</p>
<p class="first">Dorothy Hardy</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>To their surprise, however, in spite of the roaring flames the carcass remained quite
raw. Realising that some magic must be at work, they looked about them to discover
what could hinder their cookery, when they perceived an eagle perched upon a tree
above them. Seeing that he was an object of suspicion to the wayfarers, the bird addressed
them and admitted that he it was who had prevented the fire from doing its accustomed
work, but he offered to remove the spell if they would give him as much food as he
could eat. The gods agreed to do this, whereupon the eagle, swooping downward, fanned
the flames with his huge wings, and soon the meat was cooked. The eagle then made
ready to carry off three quarters of the ox as his share, but this was too much for
Loki, who seized a great stake lying near at hand, and began to belabour the voracious
bird, forgetting that it was skilled in magic arts. To his great dismay one end of
the stake stuck fast to the eagle’s back, the other to his hands, and he found himself
dragged over stones and through briers, sometimes through the air, his arms almost
torn out of their sockets. In vain he cried for mercy and implored the eagle to let
him go; the bird flew on, until he promised any ransom his captor might ask in exchange
for his release.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>The seeming eagle, who was the storm giant Thiassi, at last agreed to release Loki
upon one condition. He made him promise upon the most solemn of oaths that he would
lure Idun out of Asgard, so that Thiassi might obtain possession of her and of her
magic fruit.
</p>
<p>Released at last, Loki returned to Odin and Hoenir, to whom, however, he was very
careful not to confide the condition upon which he had obtained his freedom; and when
they had returned to Asgard he began to plan how he might entice Idun outside of the
gods’ abode. A few days later, Bragi being absent on one of his minstrel journeys,
Loki sought Idun in the groves of Brunnaker, where she had taken up her abode, and
by artfully describing some apples which grew at a short distance, and which he mendaciously
declared were exactly like hers, he lured her away from Asgard with a crystal dish
full of fruit, which she intended to compare with that which he extolled. No sooner
had Idun left Asgard, however, than the deceiver Loki forsook her, and ere she could
return to the shelter of the heavenly abode the storm giant Thiassi swept down from
the north on his eagle wings, and catching her up in his cruel talons, he bore her
swiftly away to his barren and desolate home of Thrym-heim.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p>Isolated from her beloved companions, Idun pined, grew pale and sad, but persistently
refused to give Thiassi the smallest bite of her magic fruit, which, as he well knew,
would make him beautiful and renew his strength and youth.

<p>Time passed. The gods, thinking that Idun had accompanied her husband and would soon
return, at first paid no heed to her departure, but little by little the beneficent
effect of the last feast of apples passed away. They began to feel the approach of
old age, and saw their youth and beauty disappear; so, becoming alarmed, they began
to search for the missing goddess.
</p>
<p>Close investigation revealed the fact that she had last been seen in Loki’s company,
and when Odin sternly called him to account, he was forced to admit that he had betrayed
her into the storm-giant’s power.

<h3 class="main">The Return of Idun</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The attitude of the gods now became very menacing, and it was clear to Loki that if
he did not devise means to restore the goddess, and that soon, his life would be in
considerable danger.
</p>
<p>He assured the indignant gods, therefore, that he would leave no stone unturned in
his efforts to secure <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>the release of Idun, and, borrowing Freya’s falcon plumage, he flew off to Thrym-heim,
where he found Idun alone, sadly mourning her exile from Asgard and her beloved Bragi.
Changing the fair goddess into a nut according to some accounts, or according to others,
into a swallow, Loki grasped her tightly between his claws, and then rapidly retraced
his way to Asgard, hoping that he would reach the shelter of its high walls ere Thiassi
returned from a fishing excursion in the Northern seas to which he had gone.
</p>
<p>Meantime the gods had assembled on the ramparts of the heavenly city, and they were
watching for the return of Loki with far more anxiety than they had felt for Odin
when he went in search of Od-hroerir. Remembering the success of their ruse on that
occasion, they had gathered great piles of fuel, which they were ready to set on fire
at any moment.
</p>
<p>Suddenly they saw Loki coming, but descried in his wake a great eagle. This was the
giant Thiassi who had suddenly returned to Thrym-heim and found that his captive had
been carried off by a falcon, in whom he readily recognised one of the gods. Hastily
donning his eagle plumes he had given immediate chase and was rapidly overtaking his
prey. Loki redoubled his efforts as he neared the walls of Asgard, and ere Thiassi
overtook him he reached the goal and sank exhausted in the midst of the gods. Not
a moment was lost in setting fire to the accumulated fuel, and as the pursuing Thiassi
passed over the walls in his turn, the flames and smoke brought him to the ground
crippled and half stunned, an easy prey to the gods, who fell ruthlessly upon him
and slew him.
</p>
<p>The Æsir were overjoyed at the recovery of Idun, and they hastened to partake of the
precious apples which she had brought safely back. Feeling the return <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>of their wonted strength and good looks with every mouthful they ate, they good-naturedly
declared that it was no wonder if even the giants longed to taste the apples of perpetual
youth. They vowed therefore that they would place Thiassi’s eyes as a constellation
in the heavens, in order to soften any feeling of anger which his kinsmen might experience
upon learning that he had been slain.

<p class="first">The physical explanation of this myth is obvious. Idun, the emblem of vegetation,
is forcibly carried away in autumn, when Bragi is absent and the singing of the birds
has ceased. The cold wintry wind, Thiassi, detains her in the frozen, barren north,
where she cannot thrive, until Loki, the south wind, brings back the seed or the swallow,
which are both precursors of the returning spring. The youth, beauty, and strength
conferred by Idun are symbolical of Nature’s resurrection in spring after winter’s
sleep, when colour and vigour return to the earth, which had grown wrinkled and grey.

<p class="first">As the disappearance of Idun (vegetation) was a yearly occurrence, we might expect
to find other myths dealing with the striking phenomenon, and there is another favourite
of the old scalds which, unfortunately, has come down to us only in a fragmentary
and very incomplete form. According to this account, Idun was once sitting upon the
branches of the sacred ash Yggdrasil <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>when, growing suddenly faint, she loosed her hold and dropped to the ground beneath,
and down to the lowest depths of Nifl-heim. There she lay, pale and motionless, gazing
with fixed and horror-struck eyes upon the gruesome sights of Hel’s realm, trembling
violently the while, like one overcome by penetrating cold.

stupor which his prescience told him had taken possession of her.

her pallid cheeks, and Bragi, overcome by her unhappiness, at length bade the other
gods return to Asgard without him, vowing that he would remain beside his wife until
she was ready to leave Hel’s dismal realm. The sight of her woe oppressed him so sorely
that he had no heart for his usual merry songs, and the strings of his harp were mute
while he remained in the underworld.

<p class="first">Niörd is represented in art as a very handsome god, in the prime of life, clad in
a short green tunic, with a crown of shells and seaweed upon his head, or a brown-brimmed
hat adorned with eagle or heron plumes. As <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>personification of the summer, he was invoked to still the raging storms which desolated
the coasts during the winter months. He was also implored to hasten the vernal warmth
and thereby extinguish the winter fires.
</p>
<p>As agriculture was practised only during the summer months, and principally along
the fiords or sea inlets, Niörd was also invoked for favourable harvests, for he was
said to delight in prospering those who placed their trust in him.
</p>
<p>Niörd’s first wife, according to some authorities, was his sister Nerthus, Mother
Earth, who in Germany was identified with Frigga, as we have seen, but in Scandinavia
was considered a separate divinity. Niörd was, however, obliged to part with her when
summoned to Asgard, where he occupied one of the twelve seats in the great council
hall, and was present at all the assemblies of the gods, withdrawing to Nôatûn only
when his services were not required by the Æsir.

<p class="first">Shortly after Idun’s return from Thrym-heim, and Thiassi’s death within the bounds
of Asgard, the assembled <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>gods were greatly surprised and dismayed to see Skadi, the giant’s daughter, appear
one day in their midst, to demand satisfaction for her father’s death. Although the
daughter of an ugly old Hrim-thurs, Skadi, the goddess of winter, was very beautiful
indeed, in her silvery armour, with her glittering spear, sharp-pointed arrows, short
white hunting dress, white fur leggings, and broad snowshoes; and the gods could not
but recognise the justice of her claim, wherefore they offered the usual fine in atonement.
Skadi, however, was so angry that she at first refused this compromise, and sternly
demanded a life for a life, until Loki, wishing to appease her wrath, and thinking
that if he could only make her cold lips relax in a smile the rest would be easy,
began to play all manner of pranks. Fastening a goat to himself by an invisible cord,
he went through a series of antics, which were reproduced by the goat; and the sight
was so grotesque that all the gods fairly shouted with merriment, and even Skadi was
forced to smile.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this softened mood, the gods pointed to the firmament where her
father’s eyes glowed like radiant stars in the northern hemisphere. They told her
they had placed them there to show him all honour, and finally added that she might
select as husband any of the gods present at the assembly, providing she were content
to judge of their attractions by their naked feet.
</p>
<p>Blindfolded, so that she could see only the feet of the gods standing in a circle
around her, Skadi looked about her and her gaze fell upon a pair of beautifully formed
feet. She felt sure they must belong to Balder, the god of light, whose bright face
had charmed her, and she designated their owner as her choice.
</p>
<p>When the bandage was removed, however, she discovered <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>to her chagrin that she had chosen Niörd, to whom her troth was plighted; but notwithstanding
her disappointment, she spent a happy honeymoon in Asgard, where all seemed to delight
in doing her honour. After this, Niörd took his bride home to Nôatûn, where the monotonous
sound of the waves, the shrieking of the gulls, and the cries of the seals so disturbed
Skadi’s slumbers that she finally declared it was quite impossible for her to remain
there any longer, and she implored her husband to take her back to her native Thrym-heim.

<p>According to other accounts, however, Skadi eventually married Uller, the winter-god.
As Skadi was a skilful marksman, she is represented with bow and arrow, and, as goddess
of the chase, she is generally accompanied by one of the wolf-like Eskimo dogs so
common in the North. Skadi was invoked by hunters and by winter travellers, whose
sleighs she would guide over the snow and ice, thus helping them to reach their destination
in safety.
</p>
<p>Skadi’s anger against the gods, who had slain her father, the storm giant, is an emblem
of the unbending rigidity of the ice-enveloped earth, which, softened at <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>last by the frolicsome play of Loki (the heat lightning), smiles, and permits the
embrace of Niörd (summer). His love, however, cannot hold her for more than three
months of the year (typified in the myth by nights), as she is always secretly longing
for the wintry storms and for her wonted activities among the mountains.

<p class="first">Frey, or Fro, as he was called in Germany, was the son of Niörd and Nerthus, or of
Niörd and Skadi, and was born in Vana-heim. He therefore belonged to the race of the
Vanas, the divinities of water and air, but was warmly welcomed in Asgard when he
came thither as hostage with his father. As it was customary among the Northern nations
to bestow some valuable gift upon a child when he cut his first tooth, the Æsir gave
the infant Frey the beautiful realm of Alf-heim or Fairyland, the home of the Light
Elves.

<p>Here Frey, the god of the golden sunshine and the warm summer showers, took up his
abode, charmed with the society of the elves and fairies, who implicitly obeyed his
every order, and at a sign from him flitted to and fro, doing all the good in their
power, for they were pre-eminently beneficent spirits.
</p>
<p>Frey also received from the gods a marvellous sword (an emblem of the sunbeams), which
had the power of fighting successfully, and of its own accord, as soon as it was drawn
from its sheath. Frey wielded this principally against the frost giants, whom he hated
almost as much as did Thor, and because he carried this glittering weapon, he has
sometimes been confounded with the sword-god Tyr or Saxnot.

<p>The dwarfs from Svart-alfa-heim gave Frey the golden-bristled boar Gullin-bursti (the
golden-bristled), a personification of the sun. The radiant bristles of this animal
were considered symbolical either of the solar rays, of the golden grain, which at
his bidding waved over the harvest fields of Midgard, or of agriculture; for the boar
(by tearing up the ground with his sharp tusk) was supposed to have first taught mankind
how to plough.

<p>Frey was, moreover, the proud possessor not only of the dauntless steed Blodug-hofi,

<h3 class="main">The Wooing of Gerda</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is related in one of the lays of the Edda that Frey once ventured to ascend Odin’s
throne Hlidskialf, from which exalted seat his gaze ranged over the wide earth. Looking
towards the frozen North, he saw a beautiful young maiden enter the house of the frost
giant Gymir, and as she raised her hand to lift the latch her radiant beauty illuminated
sea and sky.
</p>
<p>A moment later, this lovely creature, whose name was Gerda, and who is considered
as a personification of the flashing Northern lights, vanished within her father’s
house, and Frey pensively wended his way back to Alfheim, his heart oppressed with
longing to make this fair maiden his wife. Being deeply in love, he was melancholy
and absent-minded in the extreme, and began to behave so strangely that his father,
Niörd, became greatly alarmed about his health, and bade his favourite servant, Skirnir,
discover the cause of this sudden change. After much persuasion, Skirnir finally won
from Frey an account of his ascent of Hlidskialf, and of the fair vision he had seen.
He confessed his love and also his utter despair, for as Gerda was the daughter of
Gymir and Angur-boda, and a relative of the murdered giant Thiassi, he feared she
would never view his suit with favour.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In Gymer’s court I saw her move,
</p>
<p class="line">The maid who fires my breast with love;
</p>
<p class="line">Her snow-white arms and bosom fair
</p>

</p>
<p class="line">Dear is she to my wishes, more
</p>
<p class="line">Than e’er was maid to youth before;
</p>
<p class="line">But gods and elves, I wot it well,
</p>
<p class="line">Forbid that we together dwell.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Skirner’s Lay (Herbert’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Skirnir, however, replied consolingly that he could <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>see no reason why his master should take a despondent view of the case, and he offered
to go and woo the maiden in his name, providing Frey would lend him his steed for
the journey, and give him his glittering sword for reward.
</p>
<p>Overjoyed at the prospect of winning the beautiful Gerda, Frey willingly handed Skirnir
the flashing sword, and gave him permission to use his horse. But he quickly relapsed
into the state of reverie which had become usual with him since falling in love, and
thus he did not notice that Skirnir was still hovering near him, nor did he perceive
him cunningly steal the reflection of his face from the surface of the brook near
which he was seated, and imprison it in his drinking horn, with intent “to pour it
out in Gerda’s cup, and by its beauty win the heart of the giantess for the lord”
for whom he was about to go a-wooing. Provided with this portrait, with eleven golden
apples, and with the magic ring Draupnir, Skirnir now rode off to Jötun-heim, to fulfil
his embassy. As he came near Gymir’s dwelling he heard the loud and persistent howling
of his watch-dogs, which were personifications of the wintry winds. A shepherd, guarding
his flock in the vicinity, told him, in answer to his inquiry, that it would be impossible
to approach the house, on account of the flaming barrier which surrounded it; but
Skirnir, knowing that Blodug-hofi would dash through any fire, merely set spurs to
his steed, and, riding up unscathed to the giant’s door, was soon ushered into the
presence of the lovely Gerda.
</p>
<p>To induce the fair maiden to lend a favourable ear to his master’s proposals, Skirnir
showed her the stolen portrait, and proffered the golden apples and magic ring, which,
however, she haughtily refused to accept, declaring that her father had gold enough
and to spare.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I take not, I, that wondrous ring,

<p class="line">Enough for me my father’s dower.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Skirner’s Lay (Herbert’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Indignant at her scorn, Skirnir now threatened to decapitate her with his magic sword,
but as this did not in the least frighten the maiden, and she calmly defied him, he
had recourse to magic arts. Cutting runes in his stick, he told her that unless she
yielded ere the spell was ended, she would be condemned either to eternal celibacy,
or to marry some aged frost giant whom she could never love.
</p>
<p>Terrified into submission by the frightful description of her cheerless future in
case she persisted in her refusal, Gerda finally consented to become Frey’s wife,
and dismissed Skirnir, promising to meet her future spouse on the ninth night, in
the land of Buri, the green grove, where she would dispel his sadness and make him
happy.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Burri is hight the seat of love;

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Skirner’s Lay (Herbert’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Delighted with his success, Skirnir hurried back to Alf-heim, where Frey came eagerly
to learn the result of his journey. When he learned that Gerda had consented to become
his wife, his face grew radiant with joy; but when Skirnir informed him that he would
have to wait nine nights ere he could behold his promised bride, he turned sadly away,
declaring the time would appear interminable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Skirner’s Lay (Herbert’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>In spite of this loverlike despondency, however, the time of waiting came to an end,
and Frey joyfully hastened to the green grove, where, true to her appointment, he
found Gerda, and she became his happy wife, and proudly sat upon his throne beside
him.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sæmund’s Edda (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>According to some mythologists, Gerda is not a personification of the aurora borealis,
but of the earth, which, hard, cold, and unyielding, resists the spring-god’s proffers
of adornment and fruitfulness (the apples and ring), defies the flashing sunbeams
(Frey’s sword), and only consents to receive his kiss when it learns that it will
else be doomed to perpetual barrenness, or given over entirely into the power of the
giants (ice and snow). The nine nights of waiting are typical of the nine winter months,
at the end of which the earth becomes the bride of the sun, in the groves where the
trees are budding forth into leaf and blossom.
</p>
<p>Frey and Gerda, we are told, became the parents of a son called Fiolnir, whose birth
consoled Gerda for the loss of her brother Beli. The latter had attacked Frey and
had been slain by him, although the sun-god, deprived of his matchless sword, had
been obliged to defend himself with a stag horn which he hastily snatched from the
wall of his dwelling.
</p>
<p>Besides the faithful Skirnir, Frey had two other <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>attendants, a married couple, Beyggvir and Beyla, the personifications of mill refuse
and manure, which two ingredients, being used in agriculture for fertilising purposes,
were therefore considered Frey’s faithful servants, in spite of their unpleasant qualities.

<h3 class="main">The historical Frey</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Snorro-Sturleson, in his “Heimskringla,” or chronicle of the ancient kings of Norway,
<span class="corr" id="xd32e3343" title="Source: state">states</span> that Frey was an historical personage who bore the name of Ingvi-Frey, and ruled
in Upsala after the death of the semi-historical Odin and Niörd. Under his rule the
people enjoyed such prosperity and peace that they declared their king must be a god.
They therefore began to invoke him as such, carrying their enthusiastic admiration
to such lengths that when he died the priests, not daring to reveal the fact, laid
him in a great mound instead of burning his body, as had been customary until then.
They then informed the people that Frey—whose name was the Northern synonym for “master”—had
“gone into the mound,” an expression which eventually became the Northman’s phrase
for death.
</p>
<p>Not until three years later did the people, who had continued paying their taxes to
the king by pouring gold, silver, and copper coin into the mound through three different
openings, discover that Frey was dead. As their peace and prosperity had remained
undisturbed, they decreed that his corpse should never be burned, and they thus inaugurated
the custom of mound-burial, which in due time supplanted the funeral pyre in many
places. One of the three mounds near Gamla Upsala still bears this god’s name. His
statues were placed in the great temple there, and his name was duly mentioned in
all solemn oaths, of which the usual formula was, “So help me Frey, Niörd, and the
Almighty Asa” (Odin).

ere the above-mentioned oath was solemnly taken upon it.
</p>
<p>Frey’s statues, like those of all the other Northern divinities, were roughly hewn
blocks of wood, and the last of these sacred images seems to have been destroyed by
Olaf the Saint, who, as we have seen, forcibly converted many of his subjects. Besides

<h3 class="main">The Yule Feast</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One month of every year, the Yule month, or Thor’s month, was considered sacred to
Frey as well as to Thor, and began on the longest night of the year, which bore the
name of Mother Night. This month was a time of feasting and rejoicing, for it heralded
the return of the sun. The festival was called Yule (wheel) because the sun was supposed
to resemble a wheel rapidly revolving across the sky. This resemblance gave rise to
a singular custom in England, Germany, and along the banks of the Moselle. Until within
late years, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>people were wont to assemble yearly upon a mountain, to set fire to a huge wooden
wheel, twined with straw, which, all ablaze, was then sent rolling down the hill,
to plunge with a hiss into the water.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Some others get a rotten Wheele, all worn and cast aside,

</p>
<p>All the Northern races considered the Yule feast the greatest of the year, and were
wont to celebrate it with dancing, feasting, and drinking, each god being pledged
by name. The first Christian missionaries, perceiving the extreme popularity of this
feast, thought it best to encourage drinking to the health of the Lord and his twelve
apostles when they first began to convert the Northern heathens. In honour of Frey,
boar’s flesh was eaten on this occasion. Crowned with laurel and rosemary, the animal’s
head was brought into the banqueting-hall with much ceremony—a custom long after observed,
as the following lines will show:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Queen’s College Carol, Oxford.</i>
</p>
<p>The father of the family laid his hand on the sacred dish, which was called “the boar
of atonement,” swearing he would be faithful to his family, and would <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>fulfil all his obligations—an example which was followed by all present, from the
highest to the lowest. This dish could be carved only by a man of unblemished reputation
and tried courage, for the boar’s head was a sacred emblem which was supposed to inspire
every one with fear. For that reason a boar’s head was frequently used as ornament
for the helmets of Northern kings and heroes whose bravery was unquestioned.
</p>
<p>As Frey’s name of Fro is phonetically the same as the word used in German for gladness,
he was considered the patron of every joy, and was invariably invoked by married couples
who wished to live in harmony. Those who succeeded in doing so for a certain length
of time were publicly rewarded by the gift of a piece of boar’s flesh, for which in
later times, the English and Viennese substituted a flitch of bacon or a ham.

</p>
<p>At the village of Dunmow in Essex, the ancient custom is still observed. In Vienna
the ham or flitch <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>of bacon was hung over the city gate, whence the successful candidate was expected
to bring it down, after he had satisfied the judges that he lived in peace with his
wife, but was not under petticoat rule. It is said that in Vienna this ham remained
for a long time unclaimed until at last a worthy burgher presented himself before
the judges, bearing his wife’s written affidavit that they had been married twelve
years and had never disagreed—a statement which was confirmed by all their neighbours.
The judges, satisfied with the proofs laid before them, told the candidate that the
prize was his, and that he only need climb the ladder placed beneath it and bring
it down. Rejoicing at having secured such a fine ham, the man speedily mounted the
ladder; but as he was about to reach for the prize he noticed that the ham, exposed
to the noonday sun, was beginning to melt, and that a drop of fat threatened to fall
upon his Sunday coat. Hastily beating a retreat, he pulled off his coat, jocosely
remarking that his wife would scold him roundly were he to stain it, a confession
which made the bystanders roar with laughter, and which cost him his ham.
</p>
<p>Another Yuletide custom was the burning of a huge log, which had to last through the
night, otherwise it was considered a very bad omen indeed. The charred remains of
this log were carefully collected, and treasured up for the purpose of setting fire
to the log of the following year.

King Olaf, seeing how dear it was to the Northern heart, transferred most of its observances

<p>As god of peace and prosperity, Frey is supposed to have reappeared upon earth many
times, and to have ruled the Swedes under the name of Ingvi-Frey, whence his descendants
were called Inglings. He also governed the Danes under the name of Fridleef. In Denmark
he is said to have married the beautiful maiden Freygerda, whom he had rescued from
a dragon. By her he had a son named Frodi, who, in due time, succeeded him as king.

a visit to Sweden, he saw and purchased as slaves the two giantesses Menia and Fenia,
whose powerful muscles and frames had attracted his attention.
</p>
<p>On his return home, Peace Frodi led his new servants to the mill, and bade them turn
the grindstones and grind out gold, peace, and prosperity, and they immediately <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>fulfilled his wishes. Cheerfully the women worked on, hour after hour, until the king’s
coffers were overflowing with gold, and prosperity and peace were rife throughout
his land.

<p>But when Menia and Fenia would fain have rested awhile, the king, whose greed had
been excited, bade them work on. In spite of their entreaties he forced them to labour
hour after hour, allowing them only as much time to rest as was required for the singing
of a verse in a song, until exasperated by his cruelty, the giantesses resolved at
length to have revenge. One night while Frodi slept they changed their song, and,
instead of prosperity and peace, they grimly began to grind an armed host, whereby
they induced the Viking Mysinger to land with a large body of troops. While the spell
was working the Danes continued in slumber, and thus they were completely surprised
by the Viking host, who slew them all.

<p>Mysinger took the magic millstones Grotti and the two slaves and put them on board
his vessel, bidding the women grind salt, which was a very valuable staple of commerce
at that time. The women obeyed, and their millstones went round, grinding salt in
abundance; but the Viking, as cruel as Frodi, would give the poor <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>women no rest, wherefore a heavy punishment overtook him and his followers. Such an
immense quantity of salt was ground by the magic millstones that in the end its weight
sunk the ship and all on board.
</p>
<p>The ponderous stones sank into the sea in the Pentland Firth, or off the north-western
coast of Norway, making a deep round hole, and the waters, rushing into the vortex
and gurgling in the holes in the centre of the stones, produced the great whirlpool
which is known as the Maelstrom. As for the salt it soon melted; but such was the
immense quantity ground by the giantesses that it permeated all the waters of the
sea, which have ever since been very salt.

<p class="first">Freya, the fair Northern goddess of beauty and love, was the sister of Frey and the
daughter of Niörd and Nerthus, or Skadi. She was the most beautiful and best beloved
of all the goddesses, and while in Germany she was identified with Frigga, in Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland she was considered a separate divinity. Freya, having
been born in Vana-heim, was also known as Vanadis, the goddess of the Vanas, or as
Vanabride.
</p>
<p>When she reached Asgard, the gods were so charmed by her beauty and grace that they
bestowed upon her the realm of Folkvang and the great hall Sessrymnir (the roomy-seated),
where they assured her she could easily accommodate all her guests.

<p class="first">Although goddess of love, Freya was not soft and pleasure-loving only, for the ancient
Northern races believed that she had very martial tastes, and that as Valfreya she
often led the Valkyrs down to the battlefields, choosing and claiming one half the
heroes slain. She was therefore often represented with corselet and helmet, shield
and spear, the lower part of her body only being clad in the usual flowing feminine
garb.
</p>
<p>Freya transported the chosen slain to Folkvang, where they were duly entertained.
There also she <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>welcomed all pure maidens and faithful wives, that they might enjoy the company of
their lovers and husbands after death. The joys of her abode were so enticing to the
heroic Northern women that they often rushed into battle when their loved ones were
slain, hoping to meet with the same fate; or they fell upon their swords, or were
voluntarily burned on the same funeral pyre as the remains of their beloved.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Freya, the golden-haired and blue-eyed goddess, was also, at times, considered as
a personification of the earth. As such she married Odur, a symbol of the summer sun,
whom she dearly loved, and by whom she had two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. These
maidens were so beautiful that all things lovely and precious were called by their
names.
</p>
<p>While Odur lingered contentedly at her side, Freya was smiling and perfectly happy;
but, alas! the god was a rover at heart, and, wearying of his wife’s company, he suddenly
left home and wandered far out into the wide world. Freya, sad and forsaken, wept
abundantly, and her tears fell upon the hard rocks, which softened at their contact.
We are told even that they trickled down to the very centre of the stones, where they
were transformed to gold. Some tears fell into the sea and were changed into translucent
amber.
</p>
<p>Weary of her widowed condition, and longing to clasp her beloved in her arms once
more, Freya finally started out in search of him, passing through many <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>lands, where she became known by different names, such as Mardel, Horn, Gefn, Syr,
Skialf, and Thrung, inquiring of all she met whether her husband had passed that way,
and shedding everywhere so many tears that gold is to be found in all parts of the
earth.

as radiant as a bride. It is perhaps because Freya found her husband beneath the flowering
myrtle, that Northern brides, to this day, wear myrtle in preference to the conventional
orange wreath of other climes.
</p>
<p>Hand in hand, Odur and Freya now gently wended their way home once more, and in the

to have a special affection for the fairies, whom she loved to watch dancing in the
moonbeams, and for whom she reserved her daintiest flowers and sweetest honey. Odur,
Freya’s husband, besides being considered a personification of the sun, was also regarded
as an emblem of passion, or of the intoxicating pleasures of love; so the ancients
declared that it was no wonder his wife could not be happy without him.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Being goddess of beauty, Freya, naturally, was very fond of the toilet, of glittering
adornments, and of precious jewels. One day, while she was in Svart-alfa-heim, the
underground kingdom, she saw four dwarfs fashioning the most wonderful necklace she
had ever seen. Almost beside herself with longing to possess this treasure, which
was called Brisinga-men, and was an emblem of the stars, or of the fruitfulness of
the earth, Freya implored the dwarfs to give it to her; but they obstinately refused
to do so unless she would promise to grant them her favour. Having secured the necklace
at this price, Freya hastened to put it on, and its beauty so enhanced her charms
that she wore it night <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>and day, and only occasionally could be persuaded to lend it to the other divinities.
Thor, however, wore this necklace when he personated Freya in Jötun-heim, and Loki
coveted and would have stolen it, had it not been for the watchfulness of Heimdall.
</p>
<p>Freya was also the proud possessor of a falcon garb, or falcon plumes, which enabled
the wearer to flit through the air as a bird; and this garment was so invaluable that
it was twice borrowed by Loki, and was used by Freya herself when she went in search
of the missing Odur.

as riding about with her brother Frey in the chariot drawn by the golden-bristled
boar, scattering, with lavish hands, fruits and flowers to gladden the hearts of mankind.
She had a chariot of her own, however, in which she generally travelled. This was
drawn by cats, her favourite animals, the emblems of caressing fondness and sensuality,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Northern people were wont to invoke Freya not only for success in love, prosperity,
and increase, but also, at times, for aid and protection. This she vouchsafed to all
who served her truly, as appeared in the story of Ottar and Angantyr, two men who,
after disputing for some time concerning their rights to a certain piece of property,
laid their quarrel before the Thing. That popular assembly decreed that the man who
could prove that he had the longest line of noble ancestors should be declared the
winner, and a special day was appointed to investigate the genealogy of each claimant.
</p>
<p>Ottar, unable to remember the names of more than a few of his progenitors, offered
sacrifices to Freya, entreating her aid. The goddess graciously heard his prayer,
and appearing before him, she changed him into a boar, and rode off upon his back
to the dwelling of the sorceress Hyndla, a most renowned witch. By threats and entreaties,
Freya compelled the old woman to trace Ottar’s genealogy back to Odin, and to name
every individual in turn, with a synopsis of his achievements. Then, fearing lest
her votary’s memory should be unable to retain so many details, Freya further compelled
Hyndla to brew a potion of remembrance, which she gave him to drink.

<h3 class="main">The God of Winter</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Uller, the winter-god, was the son of Sif, and the stepson of Thor. His father, who
is never mentioned in the Northern sagas, must have been one of the dreaded frost
giants, for Uller loved the cold and delighted in travelling over the country on his
broad snowshoes or glittering skates. This god also delighted in the chase, and pursued
his game through the Northern forests, caring but little for ice and snow, against
which he was well protected by the thick furs in which he was always clad.
</p>
<p>As god of hunting and archery, he is represented with a quiver full of arrows and
a huge bow, and as the yew furnishes the best wood for the manufacture of these weapons,
it is said to have been his favourite tree. To have a supply of suitable wood ever
at hand ready for use, Uller took up his abode at Ydalir, the vale of yews, where
it was always very damp.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ydalir it is called,
</p>
<p class="line">Where Ullr has
</p>
<p class="line">Himself a dwelling made.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sæmund’s Edda (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>As winter-god, Uller, or Oller, as he was also called, was considered second only
to Odin, whose place he usurped during his absence in the winter months of the year.
During this period he exercised full sway over Asgard and Midgard, and even, according
to some authorities, took possession of Frigga, Odin’s wife, as related in the myth
of Vili and Ve. But as Uller was very parsimonious, and never bestowed any gifts upon
mankind, they gladly hailed the return of Odin, who drove his supplanter away, forcing
him to take refuge <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>either in the frozen North or on the tops of the Alps. Here, if we are to believe
the poets, he had built a summer house into which he retreated until, knowing Odin
had departed once more, he again dared appear in the valleys.
</p>
<p>Uller was also considered god of death, and was supposed to ride in the Wild Hunt,
and at times even to lead it. He is specially noted for his rapidity of motion, and
as the snowshoes used in Northern regions are sometimes made of bone, and turned up
in front like the prow of a ship, it was commonly reported that Uller had spoken magic
runes over a piece of bone, changing it into a vessel, which bore him over land or
sea at will.
</p>
<p>As snowshoes are shaped like a shield, and as the ice with which he yearly enveloped
the earth acts as a shield to protect it from harm during the winter, Uller was surnamed
the shield-god, and he was specially invoked by all persons about to engage in a duel
or in a desperate fight.
</p>
<p>In Christian times, his place in popular worship was taken by St. Hubert, the hunter,
who, also, was made patron of the first month of the year, which began on November
22, and was dedicated to him as the sun passed through the constellation of Sagittarius,
the bowman.
</p>
<p>In Anglo-Saxon, Uller was known as Vulder; but in some parts of Germany he was called
Holler and considered to be the husband of the fair goddess Holda, whose fields he
covered with a thick mantle of snow, to make them more fruitful when the spring came.
</p>
<p>By the Scandinavians, Uller was said to have married Skadi, Niörd’s divorced wife,
the female personification of winter and cold, and their tastes were so congenial
that they lived in perfect harmony together.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Numerous temples were dedicated to Uller in the North, and on his altars, as well
as on those of all the other gods, lay a sacred ring upon which oaths were sworn.
This ring was said to have the power of shrinking so violently as to sever the finger
of any premeditated perjurer. The people visited Uller’s shrine, especially during
the months of November and December, to entreat him to send a thick covering of snow
over their lands, as earnest of a good harvest; and as he was supposed to send out
the glorious flashes of the aurora borealis, which illumine the Northern sky during
its long night, he was considered nearly akin to Balder, the personification of light.
</p>
<p>According to other authorities, Uller was Balder’s special friend, principally because
he too spent part of the year in the dismal depths of Nifl-heim, with Hel, the goddess
of death. Uller was supposed to endure a yearly banishment thither, during the summer
months, when he was forced to resign his sway over the earth to Odin, the summer god,
and there Balder came to join him at Midsummer, the date of his disappearance from
Asgard, for then the days began to grow shorter, and the rule of light (Balder) gradually
yielded to the ever encroaching power of darkness (Hodur).

<p>As god of justice and eternal law, Forseti was supposed to preside over every judicial
assembly; he was invariably appealed to by all who were about to undergo a trial,
and it was said that he rarely failed to help the deserving.

<h3 class="main">The Story of Heligoland</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In order to facilitate the administration of justice throughout their land it is related
that the Frisians commissioned twelve of their wisest men, the Asegeir, or elders,
to collect the laws of the various families and tribes composing their nation, and
to compile from them a code which should be the basis of uniform laws. The elders,
having painstakingly finished their task of collecting this miscellaneous information,
embarked upon a small vessel, to seek some secluded spot where they might conduct
their deliberations in peace. But no sooner had they pushed away from shore than a
tempest arose, which drove their vessel far out to sea, first on this course and then
on that, until they entirely lost their bearings. In their distress the twelve jurists
called upon Forseti, begging him to help them to reach land once again, and the prayer
was scarcely ended when they perceived, to their utter surprise, that the vessel contained
a thirteenth passenger.
</p>
<p>Seizing the rudder, the newcomer silently brought the vessel round, steering it towards
the place where the waves dashed highest, and in an incredibly short space of time
they came to an island, where the steersman motioned them to disembark. In awestruck
silence the twelve men obeyed; and their surprise was further excited when they saw
the stranger fling his battle-axe, and a limpid spring gush forth from the spot on
the greensward where it fell. Imitating the stranger, all drank of this water without
a word; then they sat <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>down in a circle, marvelling because the newcomer resembled each one of them in some
particular, but yet was very different from any one of them in general aspect and
mien.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken, and the stranger began to speak in low tones, which
grew firmer and louder as he proceeded to expound a code of laws which combined all
the good points of the various existing regulations which the Asegeir had collected.
His speech being finished, the speaker vanished as suddenly and mysteriously as he
had appeared, and the twelve jurists, recovering power of speech, simultaneously exclaimed
that Forseti himself had been among them, and had delivered the code of laws by which
the Frisians should henceforth be judged. In commemoration of the god’s appearance
they declared the island upon which they stood to be holy, and they pronounced a solemn
curse upon any who might dare to desecrate its sanctity by quarrel or bloodshed. Accordingly
this island, known as Forseti’s land or Heligoland (holy land), was greatly respected
by all the Northern nations, and even the boldest vikings refrained from raiding its
shores, lest they should suffer shipwreck or meet a shameful death in punishment for
their crime.
</p>
<p>Solemn judicial assemblies were frequently held upon this sacred isle, the jurists
always drawing water and drinking it in silence, in memory of Forseti’s visit. The
waters of his spring were, moreover, considered to be so holy that all who drank of
them were held to be sacred, and even the cattle who had tasted of them might not
be slain. As Forseti was said to hold his assizes in spring, summer, and autumn, but
never in winter, it became customary, in all the Northern countries, to dispense justice
in those seasons, the people declaring that it was only when the light shone clearly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>in the heavens that right could become apparent to all, and that it would be utterly
impossible to render an equitable verdict during the dark winter season. Forseti is
seldom mentioned except in connection with Balder. He apparently had no share in the
closing battle in which all the other gods played such prominent parts.

<p>The nine mothers proceeded to nourish their babe on the strength of the earth, the
moisture of the sea, and the heat of the sun, which singular diet proved so strengthening

hastened to join his father in Asgard. He found the gods proudly contemplating the

<p>Heimdall was always depicted in resplendent white armour, and he was therefore called

which names he fully deserved, for he was as good as he was beautiful, and all the
gods loved him. Connected on his mothers’ side with the sea, he was sometimes included
with the Vanas; and as the ancient Northmen, especially the Icelanders, to whom the
surrounding sea appeared the most important element, fancied that all things had risen
out of it, they attributed to him an all-embracing knowledge and imagined him particularly
wise.

<h3 class="main">Loki and Freya</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">His extreme acuteness of hearing caused Heimdall to be disturbed one night by the
sound of soft, catlike footsteps in the direction of Freya’s palace, Folkvang. Projecting
his eagle gaze through the darkness, Heimdall perceived that the sound was produced
by Loki, who, having stealthily entered the palace as a fly, had approached Freya’s
bedside, and was trying to steal her shining golden necklace, Brisinga-men, the emblem
of the fruitfulness of the earth.
</p>
<p>Heimdall saw that the goddess was resting in her sleep in such a way that no one could
possibly unclasp the necklace without awaking her. Loki stood hesitatingly by the
bedside for a few moments, and then began rapidly to mutter the runes which enabled
the gods to change their form at will. As he did this, <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>Heimdall saw him shrivel up until he was changed to the size and form of a flea, when
he crept under the bed-clothes and bit Freya’s side, thus causing her to change her
position without being roused from sleep.
</p>
<p>The clasp was now in view, and Loki, cautiously unfastening it, secured the coveted
treasure, and forthwith proceeded to steal away with it. Heimdall immediately started
out in pursuit of the midnight thief, and quickly overtaking him, he drew his sword
from its scabbard, with intent to cut off his head, when the god transformed himself
into a flickering blue flame. Quick as thought, Heimdall changed himself into a cloud
and sent down a deluge of rain to quench the fire; but Loki as promptly altered his
form to that of a huge polar bear, and opened wide his jaws to swallow the water.
Heimdall, nothing daunted, then likewise assumed the form of a bear, and attacked
fiercely; but the combat threatening to end disastrously for Loki, the latter changed
himself into a seal, and, Heimdall imitating him, a last struggle took place, which
ended in Loki being forced to give up the necklace, which was duly restored to Freya.
</p>
<p>In this myth, Loki is an emblem of drought, or of the baleful effects of the too ardent
heat of the sun, which comes to rob the earth (Freya) of its most cherished ornament
(Brisinga-men). Heimdall is a personification of the gentle rain and dew, which after
struggling for a while with his foe, the drought, eventually conquers him and forces
him to relinquish his prize.

</p>
<p>Heimdall also shared with Bragi the honour of welcoming heroes to Valhalla, and, under
the name of Riger, was considered the divine sire of the various classes which compose
the human race, as appears in the following story:

</p>
<p>Heimdall left his place in Asgard one day to wander upon the earth, as the gods were
wont to do. He had not gone far ere he came to a poor hut on the seashore, where he
found Ai (great grandfather) and Edda (great grandmother), a poor but worthy couple,
who hospitably invited him to share their meagre meal of porridge. Heimdall, who gave
his name as Riger, gladly accepted this invitation, and remained with the couple three
whole days, teaching them many things. At the end of that time he left to resume his
journey. Some time after his visit, Edda bore a dark-skinned thick-set boy, whom she
called Thrall.
</p>
<p>Thrall soon showed uncommon physical strength and a great aptitude for all heavy work;
and when he had grown up he took to wife Thyr, a heavily built girl with sunburnt
hands and flat feet, who, like her husband, laboured early and late. Many children
were born to this couple and from them all the serfs or thralls of the Northland were
descended.

<p>After leaving the poor hut on the barren seacoast Riger had pushed inland, where ere
long he came to cultivated fields and a thrifty farmhouse. Entering this comfortable
dwelling, he found Afi (grandfather) and Amma (grandmother), who hospitably invited
him to sit down with them and share the plain but bountiful fare which was prepared
for their meal.

<p>Riger accepted the invitation and he remained three days with his hosts, imparting
the while all manner of useful knowledge to them. After his departure from their house,
Amma gave birth to a blue-eyed sturdy boy, whom she called Karl. As he grew up he
exhibited great skill in agricultural pursuits, and in due course he married a buxom
and thrifty wife named Snor, who bore him many children, from whom the race of husbandmen

<p>Riger tarried three days with this couple, afterwards returning to Himinbiorg to resume
his post as guardian of Asa-bridge; and ere long the lady of the castle bore a handsome,
slenderly built little son, whom she called Jarl. This child early showed a great
taste for the hunt and all manner of martial exercises, learned to understand runes,
and lived to do great deeds of valour which made his name distinguished and added
glory to his race. Having attained manhood, Jarl married Erna, an aristocratic, slender-waisted

helmet, which he often donned when he prepared to take part in war, and sometimes

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once, oppressed by shadowy fears for the future, and unable to obtain from the Norns
satisfactory answers to his questions, Odin bade Hermod don his armour and saddle
Sleipnir, which he alone, besides Odin, was allowed to ride, and hasten off to the
land of the Finns. This people, who lived in the frozen regions of the pole, besides
being able to call up the cold storms which swept down from the North, bringing much
ice and snow in their train, were supposed to have great occult powers.
</p>
<p>The most noted of these Finnish magicians was Rossthiof (the horse thief) who was
wont to entice travellers into his realm by magic arts, that he might rob and slay
them; and he had power to predict the future, although he was always very reluctant
to do so.
</p>
<p>Hermod, “the swift,” rode rapidly northward, with directions to seek this Finn, and
instead of his own wand, he carried Odin’s runic staff, which Allfather had given
him for the purpose of dispelling any obstacles that Rossthiof might conjure up to
hinder his advance. In spite, therefore, of phantom-like monsters and of <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>invisible snares and pitfalls, Hermod was enabled safely to reach the magician’s abode,
and upon the giant attacking him, he was able to master him with ease, and he bound
him hand and foot, declaring that he would not set him free until he promised to reveal
all that he wished to know.
</p>
<p>Rossthiof, seeing that there was no hope of escape, pledged himself to do as his captor
wished, and upon being set at liberty, he began forthwith to mutter incantations,
at the mere sound of which the sun hid behind the clouds, the earth trembled and quivered,
and the storm winds howled like a pack of hungry wolves.
</p>
<p>Pointing to the horizon, the magician bade Hermod look, and the swift god saw in the
distance a great stream of blood reddening the ground. While he gazed wonderingly
at this stream, a beautiful woman suddenly appeared, and a moment later a little boy
stood beside her. To the god’s amazement, this child grew with such marvellous rapidity
that he soon attained his full growth, and Hermod further noticed that he fiercely
brandished a bow and arrows.
</p>
<p>Rossthiof now began to explain the omens which his art had conjured up, and he declared
that the stream of blood portended the murder of one of Odin’s sons, but that if the
father of the gods should woo and win Rinda, in the land of the Ruthenes (Russia),
she would bear him a son who would attain his full growth in a few hours and would
avenge his brother’s death.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is related that Odin once loved the beautiful giantess Grid, who dwelt in a cave
in the desert, and that, wooing her, he prevailed upon her to become his wife. The
offspring of this union between Odin (mind) and Grid (matter) was Vidar, a son as
strong as he was taciturn, whom the ancients considered a personification of the primæval
forest or of the imperishable forces of Nature.
</p>
<p>As the gods, through Heimdall, were intimately connected with the sea, they were also
bound by close ties to the forests and Nature in general through Vidar, surnamed “the
silent,” who was destined to survive their destruction and rule over a regenerated
earth. This god had his habitation in Landvidi (the wide land), a palace decorated
with green boughs and fresh flowers, situated in the midst of an impenetrable primæval
forest where reigned the deep silence and solitude which he loved.

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Norse Mythology (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
</p>
<p>This old Scandinavian conception of the silent Vidar is indeed very grand and poetical,
and was inspired by the rugged Northern scenery. “Who has ever wandered through such
forests, in a length of many miles, in a boundless expanse, without a path, without
a goal, amid their monstrous shadows, their sacred gloom, without being filled with
deep reverence for the sublime greatness of Nature above all human agency, without
feeling the grandeur of the idea which forms the basis of Vidar’s essence?”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vidar is depicted as tall, well-made, and handsome, clad in armour, girded with a
broad-bladed sword, and shod with a great iron or leather shoe. According to some
mythologists, he owed this peculiar footgear to his mother Grid, who, knowing that
he would be called upon to fight against fire on the last day, designed it as a protection
against the fiery element, as her iron gauntlet had shielded Thor in his encounter
with Geirrod. But other authorities state that this shoe was made of the leather scraps
which Northern cobblers had either given or thrown away. As it was essential that
the shoe should be large and strong enough to resist the Fenris wolf’s sharp teeth
at the last day, it was a matter of religious observance among Northern shoemakers
to give away as many odds and ends of leather as possible.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Vidar joined his peers in Valhalla, they welcomed him gaily, for they knew that
his great strength would serve them well in their time of need. After they had lovingly
regaled him with the golden mead, Allfather bade him follow to the Urdar fountain,
where the Norns were ever busy weaving their web. Questioned by Odin concerning his
future and Vidar’s destiny, the three sisters answered oracularly; each uttering a
sentence:
</p>
<p>“<i>Early begun.</i>”
</p>
<p>“<i>Further spun.</i>”
</p>
<p>“<i>One day done.</i>”
</p>
<p>To these their mother, Wyrd, the primitive goddess of fate, added: “<i>With joy once more won.</i>” These mysterious answers would have remained totally unintelligible had the goddess
not gone on to explain that <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>time progresses, that all must change, but that even if the father fell in the last
battle, his son Vidar would be his avenger, and would live to rule over a regenerated
world, after having conquered all his enemies.

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Norse Mythology (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
</p>
<p>As Wyrd spoke, the leaves of the world tree fluttered as if agitated by a breeze,
the eagle on its topmost bough flapped its wings, and the serpent Nidhug for a moment
suspended its work of destruction at the roots of the tree. Grid, joining the father
and son, rejoiced with Odin when she heard that their son was destined to survive
the older gods and to rule over the new heaven and earth.

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Norse Mythology (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
</p>
<p>Vidar, however, uttered not a word, but slowly wended his way back to his palace Landvidi,
in the heart of the primæval forest, and there, sitting upon his throne, he pondered
long about eternity, futurity, and infinity. If he fathomed their secrets he never
revealed them, for the ancients averred that he was “as silent as the grave”—a silence
which indicated that no man knows what awaits him in the life to come.
</p>
<p>Vidar was not only a personification of the imperish-ability of Nature, but he was
also a symbol of resurrection and renewal, exhibiting the eternal truth that new shoots
and blossoms will spring forth to replace those which have fallen into decay.
</p>
<p>The shoe he wore was to be his defence against the <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>wolf Fenris, who, having destroyed Odin, would direct his wrath against him, and open
wide his terrible jaws to devour him. But the old Northmen declared that Vidar would
brace the foot thus protected against the monster’s lower jaw, and, seizing the upper,
would struggle with him until he had rent him in twain.
</p>
<p>As one shoe only is mentioned in the Vidar myths, some mythologists suppose that he
had but one leg, and was the personification of a waterspout, which would rise suddenly
on the last day to quench the wild fire personified by the terrible wolf Fenris.

<h3 class="main">The Wooing of Rinda</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Billing, king of the Ruthenes, was sorely dismayed when he heard that a great force
was about to invade his kingdom, for he was too old to fight as of yore, and his only
child, a daughter named Rinda, although she was of marriageable age, obstinately refused
to choose a husband from among her many suitors, and thus give her father the help
which he so sadly needed.
</p>
<p>While Billing was musing disconsolately in his hall, a stranger suddenly entered his
palace. Looking up, the king beheld a middle-aged man wrapped in a wide cloak, with
a broad-brimmed hat drawn down over his forehead to conceal the fact that he had but
one eye. The stranger courteously enquired the cause of his evident depression, and
as there was that in his bearing that compelled confidence, the king told him all,
and at the end of the relation he volunteered to command the army of the Ruthenes
against their foe.
</p>
<p>His services being joyfully accepted, it was not long ere Odin—for it was he—won a
signal victory, and, returning in triumph, he asked permission to woo the king’s daughter
Rinda for his wife. Despite the suitor’s advancing years, Billing hoped that his daughter
would lend a favourable ear to a wooer who appeared to be very distinguished, and
he immediately signified his consent. So Odin, still unknown, presented himself before
the princess, but she scornfully rejected his proposal, and rudely boxed his ears
when he attempted to kiss her.
</p>
<p>Forced to withdraw, Odin nevertheless did not relinquish his purpose to make Rinda
his wife, for he knew, thanks to Rossthiof’s prophecy, that none but she <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>could bring forth the destined avenger of his murdered son. His next step, therefore,
was to assume the form of a smith, in which guise he came back to Billing’s hall,
and fashioning costly ornaments of silver and gold, he so artfully multiplied these
precious trinkets that the king joyfully acquiesced when he inquired whether he might
pay his addresses to the princess. The smith, Rosterus as he announced himself, was,
however, as unceremoniously dismissed by Rinda as the successful general had been;
but although his ear once again tingled with the force of her blow, he was more determined
than ever to make her his wife.
</p>
<p>The next time Odin presented himself before the capricious damsel, he was disguised
as a dashing warrior, for, thought he, a young soldier might perchance touch the maiden’s
heart; but when he again attempted to kiss her, she pushed him back so suddenly that
he stumbled and fell upon one knee.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Many a fair maiden

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sœmund’s Edda (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>This third insult so enraged Odin that he drew his magic rune stick out of his breast,
pointed it at Rinda, and uttered such a terrible spell that she fell back into the
arms of her attendants rigid and apparently lifeless.
</p>
<p>When the princess came to life again, her suitor had disappeared, but the king discovered
with great dismay <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>that she had entirely lost her senses and was melancholy mad. In vain all the physicians
were summoned and all their simples tried; the maiden remained passive and sad, and
her distracted father had well-nigh abandoned hope when an old woman, who announced
herself as Vecha, or Vak, appeared and offered to undertake the cure of the princess.
The seeming old woman, who was Odin in disguise, first prescribed a foot-bath for
the patient; but as this did not appear to have any very marked effect, she proposed
to try a more drastic treatment. For this, Vecha declared, the patient must be entrusted
to her exclusive care, securely bound so that she could not offer the least resistance.
Billing, anxious to save his child, was ready to assent to anything; and having thus
gained full power over Rinda, Odin compelled her to wed him, releasing her from bonds
and spell only when she had faithfully promised to be his wife.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prophecy of Rossthiof was now fulfilled, for Rinda duly bore a son named Vali
(Ali, Bous, or Beav), a personification of the lengthening days, who grew with such
marvellous rapidity that in the course of a single day he attained his full stature.
Without waiting even to wash his face or comb his hair, this young god hastened to
Asgard, bow and arrow in hand, to avenge the death of Balder upon his murderer, Hodur,
the blind god of darkness.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Valhalla (J.&nbsp;C. Jones).</i>
</p>
<p>In this myth, Rinda, a personification of the hard-frozen rind of the earth, resists
the warm wooing of the sun, Odin, who vainly points out that spring is the time for
warlike exploits, and offers the adornments of golden summer. She only yields when,
after a shower (the footbath), a thaw sets in. Conquered then by the sun’s irresistible
might, the earth yields to his embrace, is freed from the spell (ice) which made her
hard and cold, and brings forth Vali the nourisher, or Bous the peasant, who emerges
from his dark hut when the pleasant days have come. The slaying of Hodur by Vali is
therefore emblematical of “the breaking forth of new light after wintry darkness.”
</p>
<p>Vali, who ranked as one of the twelve deities occupying seats in the great hall of
Glads-heim, shared with his father the dwelling called Valaskialf, and was destined,
even before birth, to survive the last battle and twilight of the gods, and to reign
with Vidar over the regenerated earth.

<p class="first">Vali is god of eternal light, as Vidar is of imperishable matter; and as beams of
light were often called arrows, he is always represented and worshipped as an archer.
For that reason his month in Norwegian calendars is designated by the sign of the
bow, and is called Lios-beri, the light-bringing. As it falls between the middle of
January and of February, the early Christians dedicated this month to St. Valentine,
who was also a skilful archer, and was said, like Vali, to be the harbinger of brighter
days, the awakener of tender sentiments, and the patron of all lovers.

<p class="first">The Northern goddesses of fate, who were called Norns, were in nowise subject to the
other gods, who might neither question nor influence their decrees. They were three
sisters, probably descendants of the giant Norvi, from whom sprang Nott (night). As
soon as the Golden Age was ended, and sin began to steal even into the heavenly homes
of Asgard, the Norns made their appearance under the great ash Yggdrasil, and took
up their abode near the Urdar fountain. According to some mythologists, their mission
was to warn the gods of future evil, to bid them make good use of the present, and
to teach them wholesome lessons from the past.

</p>
<p>These three sisters, whose names were Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, were personifications
of the past, present, and future. Their principal occupations were to weave the web
of fate<span class="corr" id="xd32e4110" title="Source: ;">,</span> to sprinkle daily the sacred tree with water from the Urdar fountain, and to put
fresh clay around its roots, that it might remain fresh and ever green.

hung on the branches of the tree of life, experience, and knowledge, allowing none
but Idun to pick the fruit, which was that with which the gods renewed their youth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Norns also fed and tenderly cared for two swans which swam over the mirror-like
surface of the Urdar fountain, and from this pair of birds all the swans on earth
are supposed to be descended. At times, it is said, the Norns clothed themselves with
swan plumage to visit the earth, or sported like mermaids along the coast and in various
lakes and rivers, appearing to mortals, from time to time, to foretell the future
or give them sage advice.

<h3 class="main">The Norns’ Web</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Norns sometimes wove webs so large that while one of the weavers stood on a high
mountain in the extreme east, another waded far out into the western sea. The threads
of their woof resembled cords, and varied greatly in hue, according to the nature
of the events about to occur, and a black thread, tending from north to south, was
invariably considered an omen of death. As these sisters flashed the shuttle to and
fro, they chanted a solemn song. They did not seem to weave according to their own
wishes, but blindly, as if reluctantly executing the wishes of Orlog, the eternal
law of the universe, an older and superior power, who apparently had neither beginning
nor end.
</p>
<p>Two of the Norns, Urd and Verdandi, were considered to be very beneficent indeed,
while the third, it is said, relentlessly undid their work, and often, when nearly
finished, tore it angrily to shreds, scattering the remnants to the winds of heaven.
As personifications of time, the Norns were represented as sisters of different ages
and characters, Urd (Wurd, weird) appearing very old and decrepit, continually looking
backward, as if absorbed in contemplating past events and people; Verdandi, the second
sister, young, active, and fearless, looked straight before her, while Skuld, the
type of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>future, was generally represented as closely veiled, with head turned in the direction
opposite to where Urd was gazing, and holding a book or scroll which had not yet been
opened or unrolled.
</p>
<p>These Norns were visited daily by the gods, who loved to consult them; and even Odin
himself frequently rode down to the Urdar fountain to bespeak their aid, for they
generally answered his questions, maintaining silence only about his own fate and
that of his fellow gods.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On one occasion the three sisters visited Denmark, and entered the dwelling of a nobleman
as his first child came into the world. Entering the apartment where the mother lay,
the first Norn promised that the child should be handsome and brave, and the second
that he should be prosperous and a great scald—predictions which filled the parents’
hearts with joy. Meantime news of what was taking place had gone abroad, and the neighbours
came thronging the apartment to such a degree that the pressure of the curious crowd
caused the third Norn to be pushed rudely from her chair.
</p>
<p>Angry at this insult, Skuld proudly rose and declared that her sister’s gifts should
be of no avail, since she would decree that the child should live only as long as
the taper then burning near the bedside. These ominous words filled the mother’s heart
with terror, and she tremblingly clasped her babe closer to her breast, for the taper
was nearly burned out and its extinction could not be very long delayed. The eldest
Norn, however, had no intention of seeing her prediction thus set at naught; but as
she could not force her sister to retract her words, she quickly seized the taper,
put out the light, and giving the smoking stump to the child’s mother, bade her carefully
treasure it, and never light it again until her son was weary of life.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In the mansion it was night:

<p>The boy was named Nornagesta, in honour of the Norns, and grew up to be as beautiful,
brave, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>talented as any mother could wish. When he was old enough to comprehend the gravity
of the trust his mother told him the story of the Norns’ visit, and placed in his
hands the candle end, which he treasured for many a year, placing it for safe-keeping
inside the frame of his harp. When his parents were dead, Nornagesta wandered from
place to place, taking part and distinguishing himself in every battle, singing his
heroic lays wherever he went. As he was of an enthusiastic and poetic temperament,
he did not soon weary of life, and while other heroes grew wrinkled and old, he remained
young at heart and vigorous in frame. He therefore witnessed the stirring deeds of
the heroic ages, was the boon companion of the ancient warriors, and after living
three hundred years, saw the belief in the old heathen gods gradually supplanted by
the teachings of Christian missionaries. Finally Nornagesta came to the court of King
Olaf Tryggvesson, who, according to his usual custom, converted him almost by force,
and compelled him to receive baptism. Then, wishing to convince his people that the
time for superstition was past, the king forced the aged scald to produce and light
the taper which he had so carefully guarded for more than three centuries.

Norns.

<h3 class="main">The Vala</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sometimes the Norns bore the name of Vala, or prophetesses, for they had the power
of divination—a power which was held in great honour by all the Northern races, who
believed that it was restricted to the female sex. The predictions of the Vala were
never questioned, and it is said that the Roman general Drusus was so terrified by
the appearance of Veleda, one of these prophetesses, who warned him not to cross the
Elbe, that he actually beat a retreat. She foretold his approaching death, which indeed
happened shortly after through a fall from his steed.
</p>
<p>These prophetesses, who were also known as Idises, Dises, or Hagedises, officiated
at the forest shrines and in the sacred groves, and always accompanied invading armies.
Riding ahead, or in the midst of the host, they would vehemently urge the warriors
on to victory, and when the battle was over they would often cut the bloody-eagle
upon the bodies of the captives. The blood was collected into great tubs, wherein
the Dises plunged their naked arms up to the shoulders, previous to joining in the
wild dance with which the ceremony ended.
</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that these women were greatly feared. Sacrifices were
offered to propitiate them, and it was only in later times that they were degraded
to the rank of witches, and sent to join the demon host on the Brocken, or Blocksberg,
on Valpurgisnacht.
</p>
<p>Besides the Norns or Dises, who were also regarded as protective deities, the Northmen
ascribed to each human being a guardian spirit named Fylgie, which <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>attended him through life, either in human or brute shape, and was invisible except
at the moment of death by all except the initiated few.
</p>
<p>The allegorical meaning of the Norns and of their web of fate is too patent to need
explanation; still some mythologists have made them demons of the air, and state that
their web was the woof of clouds, and that the bands of mists which they strung from
rock to tree, and from mountain to mountain, were ruthlessly torn apart by the suddenly
rising wind. Some authorities, moreover, declare that Skuld, the third Norn, was at
times a Valkyr, and at others personated the goddess of death, the terrible Hel.

<p class="first">Odin’s special attendants, the Valkyrs, or battle maidens, were either his daughters,
like Brunhild, or the offspring of mortal kings, maidens who were privileged to remain
immortal and invulnerable as long as they implicitly obeyed the god and remained virgins.
They and their steeds were the personification of the clouds, their glittering weapons
being the lightning flashes. The ancients imagined that they swept down to earth at
Valfather’s command, to choose among the slain in battle heroes worthy to taste the
joys of Valhalla, and brave enough to lend aid to the gods when the great battle should
be fought.

<p>These maidens were pictured as young and beautiful, with dazzling white arms and flowing
golden hair. They wore helmets of silver or gold, and blood-red corselets, and with
spears and shields glittering, they boldly charged through the fray on their mettlesome
white steeds. These horses galloped through the realms of air and over the quivering
Bifröst, bearing not only their fair riders, but the heroes slain, who after having
received the Valkyrs’ kiss of death, were thus immediately transported to Valhalla.

considered as divinities of the air; they were also called Norns, or wish maidens.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Valkyrs were supposed to take frequent flights to earth in swan plumage, which
they would throw off when they came to a secluded stream, that they might indulge
in a bath. Any mortal surprising them thus, and securing their plumage, could prevent
them from leaving the earth, and could even force these proud maidens to mate with
him if such were his pleasure.
</p>
<p>It is related that three of the Valkyrs, Olrun, Alvit, and Svanhvit, were once sporting
in the waters, when suddenly the three brothers Egil, Slagfinn, and Völund, or Wayland
the smith, came upon them, and securing <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>their swan plumage, the young men forced them to remain upon earth and become their
wives. The Valkyrs, thus detained, remained with their husbands nine years, but at
the end of that time, recovering their plumage, or the spell being broken in some
other way, they effected their escape.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There they stayed

<p>The brothers felt the loss of their wives extremely, and two of them, Egil and Slagfinn,
putting on their snow shoes, went in search of their loved ones, disappearing in the
cold and foggy regions of the North. The third brother, Völund, however, remained
at home, knowing all search would be of no avail, and he found solace in the contemplation
of a ring which Alvit had given him as a love-token, and he indulged the constant
hope that she would return. As he was a very clever smith, and could manufacture the
most dainty ornaments of silver and gold, as well as magic weapons which no blow could
break, he now employed his leisure in making seven hundred rings exactly like the
one which his wife had given him. These, when finished, he bound together; but one
night, on coming home from the hunt, he found that some one had carried away one ring,
leaving the others behind, and his hopes received fresh inspiration, for he told himself
that his wife had been there and would soon return for good.

<p>That selfsame night, however, he was surprised in his sleep, and bound and made prisoner
by Nidud, King of Sweden, who took possession of his sword, a choice weapon invested
with magic powers, which he reserved for his own use, and of the love ring made of
pure Rhine gold, which latter he gave to his only daughter, Bodvild. As for the unhappy
Völund himself, he was led captive to a neighbouring island, where, after being hamstrung,
in order that he should not escape, the king put him to the incessant task of forging
weapons and ornaments for his use. He also compelled him to build an intricate labyrinth,
and to this day a maze in Iceland is known as “Völund’s house.”
</p>
<p>Völund’s rage and despair increased with every new insult offered him by Nidud, and
night and day he thought upon how he might obtain revenge. Nor did he forget to provide
for his escape, and during the pauses of his labour he fashioned a pair of wings similar
to those his wife had used as a Valkyr, which he intended to don as soon as his vengeance
had been accomplished. One day the king came to visit his captive, and brought him
the stolen sword that he might repair it; but Völund cleverly substituted another
weapon so exactly like the magic sword as to deceive the king when he came again to
claim it. A few days later, Völund enticed the king’s sons into his smithy and slew
them, after which he cunningly fashioned drinking vessels out of their skulls, and
jewels out of their eyes and teeth, bestowing these upon their parents and sister.

</p>
<p>Some time after this, Bodvild, wishing to have her ring repaired, also visited the
smith’s hut, where, while waiting, she unsuspectingly partook of a magic drug, which
sent her to sleep and left her in Völund’s power. His last act of vengeance accomplished,
Völund immediately donned the wings which he had made in readiness for this day, and
grasping his sword and ring he rose slowly in the air. Directing his flight to the
palace, he perched there out of reach, and proclaimed his crimes to Nidud. The king,
beside himself with rage, summoned Egil, Völund’s brother, who had also fallen into
his power, and bade him use his marvellous skill as an archer to bring down the impudent
bird. Obeying a signal from Völund, Egil aimed for a protuberance under his wing where
a bladder full of the young princes’ blood was concealed, and the smith flew triumphantly
away without hurt, declaring that Odin would give his sword to Sigmund—a prediction
which was duly fulfilled.
</p>
<p>Völund then went to Alf-heim, where, if the legend is to be believed, he found his
beloved wife, and lived happily again with her until the twilight of the gods.
</p>
<p>But, even in Alf-heim, this clever smith continued to ply his craft, and various suits
of impenetrable armour, <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>which he is said to have fashioned, are described in later heroic poems. Besides Balmung
and Joyeuse, Sigmund’s and Charlemagne’s celebrated swords, he is reported to have

<p class="first">Although the innocent were treated kindly by Hel, and enjoyed a state of negative
bliss, it is no wonder that the inhabitants of the North shrank from the thought of
visiting her cheerless abode. And while the men preferred to mark themselves with
the spear point, to hurl themselves down from a precipice, or to be burned ere life
was quite extinct, the women did not shrink from equally heroic measures. In the extremity
of their sorrow, they did not hesitate to fling themselves down a mountain side, or
fall upon the swords which were given them at their marriage, so that their bodies
might be burned with those whom they loved, and their spirits released to join them
in the bright home of the gods.
</p>
<p>Further horrors, however, awaited those whose lives had been criminal or impure, these
spirits being banished to Nastrond, the strand of corpses, where they waded in ice-cold
streams of venom, through a cave made of wattled serpents, whose poisonous fangs were
turned towards them. After suffering untold agonies there, they were washed down into
the cauldron Hvergelmir, where the serpent Nidhug ceased for a moment gnawing the
root of the tree Yggdrasil to feed upon their bones.

sea near the coast and the other the primæval ocean whence all things were supposed
to have sprung, the Northern races recognised another sea-ruler, called Ægir or Hler,

<p>Ægir (the sea), like his brothers Kari (the air) and Loki (fire), is supposed to have
belonged to an older dynasty of the gods, for he ranked neither with the Æsir, the
Vanas, the giants, dwarfs, or elves, but was considered omnipotent within his realm.
</p>
<p>He was supposed to occasion and quiet the great tempests which swept over the deep,
and was generally represented as a gaunt old man, with long white beard and hair,
and clawlike fingers ever clutching convulsively, as though he longed to have all
things within his grasp. Whenever he appeared above the waves, it was only to pursue
and overturn vessels, and to greedily drag them to the bottom of the sea, a vocation
in which he was thought to take fiendish delight.

lurk near dangerous rocks, whither she enticed mariners, and there spread her net,

<p>Ran was considered the goddess of death for all who perished at sea, and the Northern
nations fancied that she entertained the drowned in her coral caves, where her couches
were spread to receive them, and where the mead flowed freely as in Valhalla. The
goddess was further supposed to have a great affection for gold, which was called
the “flame of the sea,” and was used to illuminate her halls. This belief originated
with the sailors, and sprang from the striking phosphorescent gleam of the waves.
To win Ran’s good graces, the Northmen were careful to hide some gold about them whenever
any special danger threatened them on the sea.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ægir and Ran had nine beautiful daughters, the Waves, or billow-maidens, whose snowy
arms and bosoms, long golden hair, deep-blue eyes, and willowy, sensuous forms were
fascinating in the extreme. These maidens delighted in sporting over the surface of
their father’s vast domain, clad lightly in transparent blue, white, or green veils.
They were very moody and capricious, however, varying from playful to sullen and apathetic
moods, and at times exciting one another almost to madness, tearing their hair and
veils, flinging themselves recklessly upon their hard beds, the rocks, chasing one
another with frantic haste, and shrieking aloud with joy or despair. But they seldom
came out to play unless their brother, the Wind, were abroad, and according to his
mood they were gentle and playful, or rough and boisterous.
</p>
<p>The Waves were generally supposed to go about in triplets, and were often said to
play around the ships of vikings whom they favoured, smoothing away every obstacle
from their course, and helping them to reach speedily their goals.

<h3 class="main">Ægir’s Brewing Kettle</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the Anglo-Saxons the sea-god Ægir was known by <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>the name of Eagor, and whenever an unusually large wave came thundering towards the
shore, the sailors were wont to cry, as the Trent boatmen still do, “Look out, Eagor
is coming!” He was also known by the name of Hler (the shelterer) among the Northern
nations, and of Gymir (the concealer), because he was always ready to hide things
in the depths of his realm, and could be depended upon not to reveal the secrets entrusted
to his care. And, because the waters of the sea were frequently said to seethe and
hiss, the ocean was often called Ægir’s brewing kettle or vat.
</p>
<p>The god’s two principal servants were Elde and Funfeng, emblems of the phosphorescence
of the sea; they were noted for their quickness and they invariably waited upon the
guests whom he invited to his banquets in the depths of the sea. Ægir sometimes left
his realm to visit the Æsir in Asgard, where he was always royally entertained, and
he delighted in Bragi’s many tales of the adventures and achievements of the gods.
Excited by these narratives, as also by the sparkling mead which accompanied them,
the god on one occasion ventured to invite the Æsir to celebrate the harvest feast
with him in Hlesey, where he promised to entertain them in his turn.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Surprised at this invitation, one of the gods ventured to remind Ægir that they were
accustomed to dainty fare; whereupon the god of the sea declared that as far as eating
was concerned they need be in no anxiety, as he was sure that he could cater for the
most fastidious appetites; but he confessed that he was not so confident about drink,
as his brewing kettle was rather small. Hearing this, Thor immediately volunteered
to procure a suitable kettle, and set out with Tyr to obtain it. <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>The two gods journeyed east of the Elivagar in Thor’s goat chariot, and leaving this
at the house of the peasant Egil, Thialfi’s father, they wended their way on foot
to the dwelling of the giant Hymir, who was known to own a kettle one mile deep and
proportionately wide.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p>Only the women were at home, however, and Tyr recognised in the elder—an ugly old
hag with nine hundred heads—his own grandmother; while the younger, a beautiful young
giantess, was, it appeared, his mother, and she received her son and his companion
hospitably, and gave them to drink.
</p>
<p>After learning their errand, Tyr’s mother bade the visitors hide under some huge kettles,
which rested upon a beam at the end of the hall, for her husband Hymir was very hasty
and often slew his would-be guests with a single baleful glance. The gods quickly
followed her advice, and no sooner were they concealed than the old giant Hymir came
in. When his wife told him that visitors had come, he frowned so portentously, and
flashed such a wrathful look towards their hiding-place, that the rafter split and
the kettles fell with a crash, and, except the largest, were all dashed to pieces.

</p>
<p>The giant’s wife, however, prevailed upon her husband to welcome Tyr and Thor, and
he slew three oxen for their refection; but great was his dismay to see the thunder-god
eat two of these for his supper. Muttering that he would have to go fishing early
the next morning to secure a breakfast for so voracious a guest, the giant retired
to rest, and when at dawn the next day he went down to the shore, he was joined by
Thor, who said that he had come to help him. The giant bade him secure his own bait,
whereupon Thor coolly slew his host’s largest ox, Himinbrioter (heaven-breaker), and
cutting off its head, he embarked with it and proceeded to row far out to sea. In
vain Hymir protested that his usual fishing-ground had been reached, and that they
might encounter the terrible Midgard snake were they to venture any farther; Thor
persistently rowed on, until he fancied they were directly above this monster.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p>Baiting his powerful hook with the ox head, Thor angled for Iörmungandr, while the
giant meantime drew up two whales, which seemed to him to be enough for an early morning
meal. He was about to propose to return, therefore, when Thor suddenly felt a jerk,
and began pulling as hard as he could, for he knew by the resistance of his prey,
and the terrible storm created by its frenzied writhings, that he had hooked the <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>Midgard snake. In his determined efforts to force the snake to rise to the surface,
Thor braced his feet so strongly against the bottom of the boat that he went through
it and stood on the bed of the sea.
</p>
<p>After an indescribable struggle, the monster’s terrible venom-breathing head appeared,
and Thor, seizing his hammer, was about to annihilate it when the giant, frightened
by the proximity of Iörmungandr, and fearing lest the boat should sink and he should
become the monster’s prey, cut the fishing-line, and thus allowed the snake to drop
back like a stone to the bottom of the sea.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p>Angry with Hymir for his inopportune interference, Thor dealt him a blow with his
hammer which knocked him overboard; but Hymir, undismayed, waded ashore, and met the
god as he returned to the beach. Hymir then took both whales, his spoil of the sea,
upon his back, to carry them to the house; and Thor, wishing also to show his strength,
shouldered boat, oars, and fishing tackle, and followed him.
</p>
<p>Breakfast being disposed of, Hymir challenged Thor to prove his strength by breaking
his beaker; but although the thunder-god threw it with irresistible force against
stone pillars and walls, it remained whole and was not even bent. In obedience to
a whisper from Tyr’s mother, however, Thor suddenly hurled the vessel against the
giant’s forehead, the only substance tougher than itself, when it fell shattered to
the ground. Hymir, having thus tested the might of Thor, told him he could have the
kettle which the two gods had come to seek, but Tyr tried to lift it in vain, and
Thor could <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>raise it from the floor only after he had drawn his belt of strength to the very last
hole.
</p>

</p>
<p>The wrench with which he finally pulled it up did great damage to the giant’s house
and his feet broke through the floor. As Tyr and Thor were departing, the latter with
the huge pot clapped on his head in place of a hat, Hymir summoned his brother frost
giants, and proposed that they should pursue and slay their inveterate foe. Turning
round, Thor suddenly became aware of their pursuit, and, hurling Miölnir repeatedly
at the giants, he slew them all ere they could overtake him. Tyr and Thor then resumed
their journey back to Ægir, carrying the kettle in which he was to brew ale for the
harvest feast.
</p>
<p>The physical explanation of this myth is, of course, a thunder storm (Thor), in conflict
with the raging sea (the Midgard snake), and the breaking up of the polar ice (Hymir’s
goblet and floor) in the heat of summer.

<h3 class="main">Legends of the Lorelei</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lorelei was an immortal, a water nymph, daughter of Father Rhine; during the day she
dwelt in the cool depths of the river bed, but late at night she would appear in the
moonlight, sitting aloft upon a pinnacle of rock, in full view of all who passed up
or down the stream. At times, the evening breeze wafted some of the notes of her song
to the boatmen’s ears, when, forgetting time and place in listening to these enchanting
melodies, they drifted upon the sharp and jagged rocks, where they invariably perished.

</div>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Song, Heine (Selcher’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>One person only is said to have seen the Lorelei close by. This was a young fisherman
from Oberwesel, who met her every evening by the riverside, and spent a few delightful
hours with her, drinking in her beauty <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>and listening to her entrancing song. Tradition had it that ere they parted the Lorelei
pointed out the places where the youth should cast his nets on the morrow—instructions
which he always obeyed, and which invariably brought him success.
</p>
<p>One night the young fisherman was seen going towards the river, but as he never returned
search was made for him. No clue to his whereabouts being found, the credulous Teutons
finally reported that the Lorelei had dragged him down to her coral caves that she
might enjoy his companionship for ever.
</p>
<p>According to another version, the Lorelei, with her entrancing strains from the craggy
rocks, lured so many fishermen to a grave in the depths of Rhine, that an armed force
was once sent at nightfall to surround and seize her. But the water nymph laid such
a powerful spell upon the captain and his men that they could move neither hand nor
foot. While they stood motionless around her, the Lorelei divested herself of her
ornaments, and cast them into the waves below; then, chanting a spell, she lured the
waters to the top of the crag upon which she was perched, and to the wonder of the
soldiers the waves enclosed a sea-green chariot drawn by white-maned steeds, and the
nymph sprang lightly into this and the magic equipage was instantly lost to view.
A few moments later the Rhine subsided to its usual level, the spell was broken, and
the men recovered power of motion, and retreated to tell how their efforts had been
baffled. Since then, however, the Lorelei has not been seen, and the peasants declare
that she still resents the insult offered her and will never again leave her coral
caves.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To Odin and Frigga, we are told, were born twin sons as dissimilar in character and
physical appearance as it was possible for two children to be. Hodur, god of darkness,
was sombre, taciturn, and blind, like the obscurity of sin, which he was supposed
to symbolise, while his brother Balder, the beautiful, was worshipped as the pure
and radiant god of innocence and light. From his snowy brow and golden locks seemed
to radiate beams of sunshine which gladdened the hearts of gods and men, by whom he
was equally beloved.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Valhalla (J.&nbsp;C. Jones).</i>
</p>
<p>The youthful Balder attained his full growth with marvellous rapidity, and was early
admitted to the council of the gods. He took up his abode in the palace of Breidablik,
whose silver roof rested upon golden pillars, and whose purity was such that nothing
common or unclean was ever allowed within its precincts, and here he lived in perfect
unity with his young wife Nanna (blossom), the daughter of Nip (bud), a beautiful
and charming goddess.
</p>
<p>The god of light was well versed in the science of runes, which were carved on his
tongue; he knew the various virtues of simples, one of which, the camomile, was called
“Balder’s brow,” because its flower was as immaculately pure as his forehead. The
only thing hidden from Balder’s radiant eyes was the perception of his own ultimate
fate.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As it was so natural for Balder the beautiful to be smiling and happy, the gods were
greatly troubled when on a day they began to notice a change in his bearing. Gradually
the light died out of his blue eyes, a careworn look came into his face, and his step
grew heavy and slow. Odin and Frigga, seeing their beloved son’s evident depression,
tenderly implored him to reveal the cause of his silent grief. Balder, yielding at
last to their anxious entreaties, confessed that his slumbers, instead of being peaceful
and restful as of yore, had been strangely troubled of late by dark and oppressive
dreams, which, although he could not clearly remember them when he awoke, constantly
haunted him with a vague feeling of fear.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“To that god his slumber

<p class="line">Was most afflicting;

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Lay of Vegtam (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>When Odin and Frigga heard this, they were very uneasy, but declared that nothing
would harm their universally beloved son. Nevertheless, when the anxious parents further
talked the matter over, they confessed that they also were oppressed by strange forebodings,
and, coming at last to believe that Balder’s life was really threatened, they proceeded
to take measures to avert the danger.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>Frigga sent her servants in every direction, with strict charge to prevail upon all
living creatures, all plants, metals, stones—in fact, every animate and inanimate
thing—to register a solemn vow not to harm Balder. All creation readily took the oath,
for there was nothing on earth which did not love the radiant god. So the servants
returned to Frigga, telling her that all had been duly sworn save the mistletoe, growing
upon the oak stem at the gate of Valhalla, and this, they added, was such a puny,
inoffensive thing that no harm could be feared from it.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<h3 class="main">The Vala’s Prophecy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Odin, in the meantime, had resolved to consult one of the dead Vala or prophetesses.
Mounted upon his eight-footed steed Sleipnir, he rode over the tremulous bridge Bifröst
and over the weary road which leads to Giallar and the entrance of Nifl-heim, where,
passing through the Helgate and by the dog Garm, he penetrated into Hel’s dark abode.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Uprose the king of men with speed,
</p>
<p class="line">And saddled straight his coal-black steed;

<p class="line">Down the yawning steep he rode,
</p>
<p class="line">That leads to Hela’s drear abode.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Descent of Odin (Gray).</i>
</p>
<p>Odin saw to his surprise that a feast was being spread in this dark realm, and that
the couches had been covered with tapestry and rings of gold, as if some highly honoured
guest were expected. But he hurried on without pausing, until he reached the spot
where the Vala had rested undisturbed for many a year, when he began solemnly to chant
a magic spell and to trace the runes which had the power of raising the dead.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Thrice pronounc’d, in accents dread,

<p class="line">Slowly breath’d a sullen sound.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Descent of Odin (Gray).</i>
</p>
<p>Suddenly the tomb opened, and the prophetess slowly rose, inquiring who had dared
thus to trouble her long rest. Odin, not wishing her to know that he was the mighty
father of gods and men, replied that he was Vegtam, son of Valtam, and that he had
awakened her to inquire for whom Hel was spreading her couches and preparing a festive
meal. In hollow tones, the prophetess confirmed all his fears by telling him that
the expected guest was Balder, who was destined to be slain by Hodur, his brother,
the blind god of darkness.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Hodur will hither
</p>
<p class="line">His glorious brother send;
</p>
<p class="line">He of Balder will
</p>
<p class="line">The slayer be,

<p class="line">And Odin’s son
</p>
<p class="line">Of life bereave.

<p class="line">By compulsion I have spoken;
</p>
<p class="line">Now I will be silent.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Sæmund’s Edda (Thorpe’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>Despite the Vala’s evident reluctance to speak further, <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>Odin was not yet satisfied, and he prevailed upon her to tell him who would avenge
the murdered god and call his slayer to account. For revenge and retaliation were
considered as a sacred duty by the races of the North.
</p>
<p>Then the prophetess told him, as Rossthiof had already predicted, that Rinda, the
earth-goddess, would bear a son to Odin, and that Vali, as this child would be named,
would neither wash his face nor comb his hair until he had avenged upon Hodur the
death of Balder.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In the caverns of the west,
</p>
<p class="line">By Odin’s fierce embrace comprest,

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Descent of Odin (Gray).</i>
</p>
<p>When the reluctant Vala had thus spoken, Odin next asked: “Who would refuse to weep
at Balder’s death?” This incautious question showed a knowledge of the future which
no mortal could possess, and immediately revealed to the Vala the identity of her
visitor. Therefore, refusing to speak another word, she sank back into the silence
of the tomb, declaring that none would be able to lure her out again until the end
of the world was come.

<p>Odin having learned the decrees of Orlog (fate), which he knew could not be set aside,
now remounted his steed, and sadly wended his way back to Asgard, thinking of the
time, not far distant, when his beloved son would no more be seen in the heavenly
abodes, and when the light of his presence would have vanished for ever.

<p>On entering Glads-heim, however, Odin was somewhat reassured by the intelligence,
promptly conveyed to him by Frigga, that all things under the sun had promised that
they would not harm Balder, and feeling convinced that if nothing would slay their
beloved son he must surely continue to gladden gods and men with his presence, he
cast care aside and resigned himself to the pleasures of the festive board.

<h3 class="main">The Gods at Play</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The playground of the gods was situated on the green plain of Ida, and was called
Idavold. Here the gods would resort when in sportive mood, and their favourite game
was to throw their golden disks, which they could cast with great skill. They had
returned to this wonted pastime with redoubled zest since the cloud which had oppressed
their spirits had been dispersed by the precautions of Frigga. Wearied at last, however,
of the accustomed sport, they bethought them of a new game. They had learned that
Balder could not be harmed by any missile, and so they amused themselves by casting
all manner of weapons, stones, etc., at him, certain that no matter how cleverly they
tried, and how accurately they aimed, the objects, having sworn not to injure him,
would either glance aside or fall short. This new amusement proved to be so fascinating
that soon all the gods gathered around Balder, greeting each new failure to hurt him
with prolonged shouts of laughter.

<h3 class="main">The Death of Balder</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These bursts of merriment excited the curiosity of Frigga, who sat spinning in Fensalir;
and seeing an old woman pass by her dwelling, she bade her pause and tell what the
gods were doing to provoke such great hilarity. The old woman was none other than
Loki in disguise, and he answered Frigga that the gods were throwing stones and other
missiles, blunt and sharp, at Balder, who stood smiling and unharmed in their midst,
challenging them to touch him.
</p>
<p>The goddess smiled, and resumed her work, saying that it was quite natural that nothing
should harm Balder, as all things loved the light, of which he was the emblem, and
had solemnly sworn not to injure him. Loki, the personification of fire, was greatly
chagrined upon hearing this, for he was jealous of Balder, the sun, who so entirely
eclipsed him and who was generally beloved, while he was feared and avoided as much
as possible; but he cleverly concealed his vexation, and inquired of Frigga whether
she were quite sure that all objects had joined the league.
</p>
<p>Frigga proudly answered that she had received the solemn oath of all things, a harmless
little parasite, the mistletoe, which grew on the oak near Valhalla’s gate, only excepted,
and this was too small and weak to be feared. This information was all that Loki wanted,
and bidding adieu to Frigga he hobbled off. As soon as he was safely out of sight,
however, he resumed his wonted form and hastened to Valhalla, where, at the gate,
he found the oak and mistletoe as indicated by Frigga. Then by the exercise of magic
arts he imparted to the parasite a size and hardness quite unnatural to it.
</p>
<p>From the wooden stem thus produced he deftly <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>fashioned a shaft with which he hastened back to Idavold, where the gods were still
hurling missiles at Balder, Hodur alone leaning mournfully against a tree the while,
and taking no part in the game. Carelessly Loki approached the blind god, and assuming
an appearance of interest, he inquired the cause of his melancholy, at the same time
artfully insinuating that pride and indifference prevented him from participating
in the sport. In answer to these remarks, Hodur pleaded that only his blindness deterred
him from taking part in the new game, and when Loki put the mistletoe-shaft in his
hand, and led him into the midst of the circle, indicating the direction of the novel
target, Hodur threw his shaft boldly. But to his dismay, instead of the loud laughter
which he expected, a shuddering cry of horror fell upon his ear, for Balder the beautiful
had fallen to the ground, pierced by the fatal mistletoe.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round

<p>In dire anxiety the gods crowded around their beloved companion, but alas! life was
quite extinct, and all their efforts to revive the fallen sun-god were unavailing.
Inconsolable at their loss, they now turned angrily upon Hodur, whom they would there
and then have slain had they not been restrained by the law of the gods that no wilful
deed of violence should desecrate their peace-steads. The sound of their loud lamentation
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>brought the goddesses in hot haste to the dreadful scene, and when Frigga saw that

Hel to release her victim, for the earth could not exist happily without him.

To enable him to do so, Odin lent him Sleipnir, and the noble steed, who was not wont
to allow any but Odin upon his back, set off without demur upon the dark road which
his hoofs had beaten twice before.

<p class="first">While Hermod was speeding along the cheerless road which led to Nifl-heim, the gods
hewed and carried down to the shore a vast amount of fuel, which they piled upon the
deck of Balder’s dragon-ship, Ringhorn, constructing an elaborate funeral pyre. According
to custom, this was decorated with tapestry hangings, garlands of flowers, vessels
and weapons of all kinds, golden rings, and countless objects of value, ere the immaculate
corpse, richly attired, was brought and laid upon it.
</p>
<p>One by one, the gods now drew near to take a last farewell of their beloved companion,
and as Nanna bent over him, her loving heart broke, and she fell lifeless by his side.
Seeing this, the gods reverently laid her beside her husband, that she might accompany
him even in death; and after they had slain his horse and hounds and twined the pyre
with thorns, the emblems of sleep, Odin, last of the gods, drew near.
</p>
<p>In token of affection for the dead and of sorrow for his loss, all had lain their
most precious possessions upon his pyre, and Odin, bending down, now added to the
offerings his magic ring Draupnir. It was noted by the assembled gods that he was
whispering in his dead son’s ear, but none were near enough to hear what word he said.

<p>These sad preliminaries ended, the gods now prepared to launch the ship, but found
that the heavy load of fuel and treasures resisted their combined efforts and they
could not make the vessel stir an inch. The mountain giants, witnessing the scene
from afar, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>noticing their quandary, now drew near and said that they knew of a giantess called
Hyrrokin, who dwelt in Jötun-heim, and was strong enough to launch the vessel without
any other aid. The gods therefore bade one of the storm giants hasten off to summon
Hyrrokin, and she soon appeared, mounted upon a gigantic wolf, which she guided by
a bridle made of writhing snakes. Riding down to the shore, the giantess dismounted
and haughtily signified her readiness to give the required aid, if in the meantime
the gods would take charge of her steed. Odin immediately despatched four of his maddest
Berserkers to hold the wolf; but, in spite of their phenomenal strength, they could
not restrain the monstrous creature until the giantess had thrown it down and bound
it fast.
</p>
<p>Hyrrokin, seeing that now they would be able to manage her refractory steed, strode
along the strand to where, high up from the water’s edge, lay Balder’s mighty ship
Ringhorn.

<p>Setting her shoulder against its stern, with a supreme effort she sent it with a rush
into the water. Such was the weight of the mass, however, and the rapidity with which
it shot down into the sea, that the earth shook as if from an earthquake, and the
rollers on which the ship glided caught fire from the friction. The unexpected shock
almost caused the gods to lose their balance, and this so angered Thor that he raised
his hammer and would have slain the giantess had he not been restrained by his companions.
Easily appeased, as <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>usual—for Thor’s temper, although quickly roused, was evanescent—he now boarded the
vessel once more to consecrate the funeral pyre with his sacred hammer. As he was
performing this ceremony, the dwarf Lit provokingly stumbled into his way, whereupon
Thor, who had not entirely recovered his equanimity, kicked him into the fire, which
he had just kindled with a thorn, and the dwarf was burned to ashes with the bodies
of the divine pair.
</p>
<p>The great ship now drifted out to sea, and the flames from the pyre presented a magnificent
spectacle, which assumed a greater glory with every passing moment, until, when the
vessel neared the western horizon, it seemed as if sea and sky were on fire. Sadly
the gods watched the glowing ship and its precious freight, until suddenly it plunged
into the waves and disappeared; nor did they turn aside and return to Asgard until
the last spark of light had vanished, and the world, in token of mourning for Balder
the good, was enveloped in a mantle of darkness.

<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sadly the gods entered Asgard, where no sounds of merriment or feasting greeted the
ear, for all hearts were filled with anxious concern for the end of all things which
was felt to be imminent. And truly the thought of the terrible Fimbul-winter, which
was to herald their death, was one well calculated to disquiet the gods.
</p>
<p>Frigga alone cherished hope, and she watched anxiously for the return of her messenger,
Hermod the swift, who, meanwhile, had ridden over the tremulous bridge, and along
the dark Hel-way, until, on the tenth night, he had crossed the rushing tide of the
river Giöll. Here he was challenged by Mödgud, who inquired why the Giallar-bridge
trembled more beneath his horse’s tread than when a whole army passed, and asked why
he, a living rider, was attempting to penetrate into the dreaded realm of Hel.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse,
</p>
<p class="line">Under whose hoofs the bridge o’er Giall’s stream

<p class="line">But yestermorn five troops of dead pass’d by,
</p>
<p class="line">Bound on their way below to Hela’s realm,
</p>
<p class="line">Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone.
</p>
<p class="line">And thou hast flesh and colour on thy cheeks,
</p>
<p class="line">Like men who live, and draw the vital air;
</p>
<p class="line">Nor look’st thou pale and wan, like man deceased,
</p>
<p class="line">Souls bound below, my daily passers here.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>Hermod explained to Mödgud the reason of his coming, and, having ascertained that
Balder and Nanna <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>had ridden over the bridge before him, he hastened on, until he came to the gate,
which rose forbiddingly before him.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Nothing daunted by this barrier, Hermod dismounted on the smooth ice, and tightening
the girths of his saddle, remounted, and burying his spurs deep into Sleipnir’s sleek
sides, he put him to a prodigious leap, which landed them safely on the other side
of Hel-gate.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Thence on he journey’d o’er the fields of ice

<p class="line">Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,

</p>
<p class="line">And made him leap the grate, and came within.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>Riding onward, Hermod came at last to Hel’s banqueting-hall, where he found Balder,
pale and dejected, lying upon a couch, his wife Nanna beside him, gazing fixedly at
a beaker of mead, which apparently he had no heart to quaff.

<h3 class="main">The Condition of Balder’s Release</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In vain Hermod informed his brother that he had come to redeem him; Balder shook his
head sadly, saying that he knew he must remain in his cheerless abode until the last
day should come, but he implored Hermod to take Nanna back with him, as the home of
the shades was no place for such a bright and beautiful creature. But when Nanna heard
this request she clung more closely to her husband’s side, vowing that nothing would
ever induce her to part from him, and that she would stay with him for ever, even
in Nifl-heim.
</p>
<p>The long night was spent in close conversation, ere Hermod sought Hel and implored
her to release Balder. The churlish goddess listened in silence to his request, <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>and declared finally that she would allow her victim to depart provided that all things
animate and inanimate would show their sorrow for his loss by shedding tears.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Come then! if Balder was so dear beloved,
</p>
<p class="line">And this is true, and such a loss is Heaven’s—
</p>

<p class="line">Show me through all the world the signs of grief!

<p class="line">Fails but one thing to grieve, here Balder stops!

<p class="line">Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones.

</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>This answer was full of encouragement, for all Nature mourned the loss of Balder,
and surely there was nothing in all creation which would withhold the tribute of a
tear. So Hermod cheerfully made his way out of Hel’s dark realm, carrying with him
the ring Draupnir, which Balder sent back to Odin, an embroidered carpet from Nanna
for Frigga, and a ring for Fulla.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The assembled gods crowded anxiously round Hermod as soon as he returned, and when
he had delivered his messages and gifts, the Æsir sent heralds to every part of the
world to bid all things animate and inanimate weep for Balder.

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Go quickly forth through all the world, and pray

<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>

hard hearts, wept too.
</p>
<p>The way at last led back to Asgard, and by the road-side was a dark cave, in which
the messengers saw, crouching, the form of a giantess named Thok, whom some mythologists
suppose to have been Loki in disguise. When she was called upon to shed a tear, she
mocked the heralds, and fleeing into the dark recesses of her cave, she declared that
no tear should fall from her eyes, and that, for all she cared, Hel might retain her
prey for ever.

<p>We have already seen how Odin succeeded after many rebuffs in securing the consent
of Rinda to their union, and that the son born of this marriage was destined to avenge
the death of Balder. The advent of this wondrous infant now took place, and Vali the
Avenger, as he was called, entered Asgard on the day of his birth, and on that very
same day he slew Hodur with an arrow from a bundle which he seems to have carried
for the purpose. Thus the murderer of Balder, unwitting instrument though he was,
atoned for the crime with his blood, according to the code of the true Norseman.

<h3 class="main">The Signification of the Story</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The physical explanation of this myth is to be found either in the daily setting of
the sun (Balder), which sinks beneath the western waves, driven away by darkness (Hodur),
or in the ending of the short Northern summer and the long reign of the winter season.
“Balder represents the bright and clear summer, when twilight and daylight kiss each
other and go hand in hand in these Northern latitudes.”
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Balder’s pyre, of the sun a mark,
</p>
<p class="line">Holy hearth red staineth;
</p>
<p class="line">Yet, soon dies its last faint spark,

<p class="line">Darkly then Hoder reigneth.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Viking Tales of the North (R.&nbsp;B. Anderson).</i>
</p>
<p>“His death by Hodur is the victory of darkness over light, the darkness of winter
over the light of summer; and the revenge by Vali is the breaking forth of new light
after the wintry darkness.”
</p>
<p>Loki, the fire, is jealous of Balder, the pure light of heaven, who alone among the
Northern gods never fought, but was always ready with words of conciliation and peace.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“But from thy lips, O Balder, night or day,
</p>
<p class="line">Heard no one ever an injurious word

<p class="line">The others, labouring to compose their brawls.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).</i>
</p>
<p>The tears shed by all things for the beloved god are symbolical of the spring thaw,
setting in after the hardness and cold of winter, when every tree and twig, and even
the stones drip with moisture; Thok (coal) alone shows no sign of tenderness, as she
is buried deep within the dark earth and needs not the light of the sun.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And as in winter, when the frost breaks up,
</p>
<p class="line">At winter’s end, before the spring begins,
</p>
<p class="line">And a warm west wind blows, and thaw sets in—
</p>
<p class="line">After an hour a dripping sound is heard
</p>
<p class="line">In all the forests, and the soft-strewn snow
</p>
<p class="line">Under the trees is dibbled thick with holes,
</p>
<p class="line">And from the boughs the snow loads shuffle down;
</p>
<p class="line">And, in fields sloping to the south, dark plots
</p>
<p class="line">Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow,
</p>
<p class="line">And widen, and the peasant’s heart is glad—
</p>
<p class="line">So through the world was heard a dripping noise
</p>
<p class="line">Of all things weeping to bring Balder back;

<p class="line">And there fell joy upon the Gods to hear.”</p>

</p>
<p>From the depths of their underground prison, the sun (Balder) and vegetation (Nanna)
try to cheer heaven (Odin) and earth (Frigga) by sending them the ring Draupnir, the
emblem of fertility, and the flowery tapestry, symbolical of the carpet of verdure
which will again deck the earth and enhance her charms with its beauty.
</p>
<p>The ethical signification of the myth is no less beautiful, for Balder and Hodur are
symbols of the conflicting forces of good and evil, while Loki impersonates the tempter.

<p class="first">One of the most important festivals was held at the summer solstice, or midsummer’s
eve, in honour of Balder the good, for it was considered the anniversary of his death
and of his descent into the lower world. On that day, the longest in the year, the
people congregated out of doors, made great bonfires, and watched the sun, which in
extreme Northern latitudes barely dips beneath the horizon ere it rises upon a new
day. From midsummer, the days gradually grow shorter, and the sun’s rays less warm,
until the winter solstice, which was called the “Mother night,” as it was the longest
night in the year. Midsummer’s eve, once celebrated in honour of Balder, is now called
St. John’s day, that saint having entirely supplanted Balder the good.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the hideous giant Utgard-Loki, the personification of mischief and evil, whom
Thor and his companions visited in Jötun-heim, the ancient Northern nations had another
type of sin, whom they called Loki also, and whom we have already seen under many
different aspects.
</p>
<p>In the beginning, Loki was merely the personification of the hearth fire and of the
spirit of life. At first a god, he gradually becomes “god and devil combined,” and
ends in being held in general detestation as an exact counterpart of the mediæval
Lucifer, the prince of lies, “the originator of deceit, and the back-biter” of the
Æsir.
</p>
<p>By some authorities Loki was said to be the brother of Odin, but others assert that
the two were not related, but had merely gone through the form of swearing blood brotherhood
common in the North.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<h3 class="main">Loki’s Character</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While Thor is the embodiment of Northern activity, Loki represents recreation, and
the close companionship early established between these two gods shows very plainly
how soon our ancestors realised that both were necessary to the welfare of mankind.
Thor is ever busy and ever in earnest, but Loki makes fun of <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>everything, until at last his love of mischief leads him entirely astray, and he loses
all love for goodness and becomes utterly selfish and malevolent.
</p>
<p>He represents evil in the seductive and seemingly beautiful form in which it parades
through the world. Because of this deceptive appearance the gods did not at first
avoid him, but treated him as one of themselves in all good-fellowship, taking him
with them wherever they went, and admitting him not only to their merry-makings, but
also to their council hall, where, unfortunately, they too often listened to his advice.
</p>
<p>As we have already seen, Loki played a prominent part in the creation of man, endowing
him with the power of motion, and causing the blood to circulate freely through his
veins, whereby he was inspired with passions. As personification of fire as well as
of mischief, Loki (lightning) is often seen with Thor (thunder), whom he accompanies
to Jötun-heim to recover his hammer, to Utgard-Loki’s castle, and to Geirrod’s house.
It is he who steals Freya’s necklace and Sif’s hair, and betrays Idun into the power
of Thiassi; and although he sometimes gives the gods good advice and affords them
real help, it is only to extricate them from some predicament into which he has rashly
inveigled them.
</p>
<p>Some authorities declare that, instead of making part of the creative trilogy (Odin,
Hoenir, and Lodur or Loki), this god originally belonged to a pre-Odinic race of deities,
and was the son of the great giant Fornjotnr (Ymir), his brothers being Kari (air)
and Hler (water), and his sister Ran, the terrible goddess of the sea. Other mythologists,
however, make him the son of the giant Farbauti, who has been identified with Bergelmir,
the sole survivor of the deluge, and of Laufeia (leafy isle) or Nal (vessel), his
mother, thus stating that his connection <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>with Odin was only that of the Northern oath of good-fellowship.
</p>
<p>Loki (fire) first married Glut (glow), who bore him two daughters, Eisa (embers) and
Einmyria (ashes); it is therefore very evident that Norsemen considered him emblematic
of the hearth-fire, and when the flaming wood crackles on the hearth the goodwives
in the North are still wont to say that Loki is beating his children. Besides this
wife, Loki is also said to have wedded the giantess Angur-boda (the anguish-boding),
who dwelt in Jötun-heim, and who, as we have already seen, bore him the three monsters:
Hel, goddess of death, the Midgard snake Iörmungandr, and the grim wolf Fenris.
</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Loki’s third marriage was with Sigyn, who proved a most loving and devoted wife, and
bore him two sons, Narve and Vali, the latter a namesake of the god who avenged Balder.
Sigyn was always faithful to her husband, and did not forsake him even after he had
definitely been cast out of Asgard and confined in the bowels of the earth.
</p>
<p>As Loki was the embodiment of evil in the minds of the Northern races, they entertained
nothing but fear of him, built no temples to his honour, offered no sacrifices to
him, and designated the most noxious weeds by his name. The quivering, overheated
atmosphere of summer was supposed to betoken his presence, for the people were then
wont to remark that Loki was sowing his wild oats, and when the sun appeared to be

<h3 class="main">Skrymsli and the Peasant’s Child</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A giant and a peasant were playing a game together one day (probably a game of chess,
which was a favourite winter pastime with the Northern vikings). They of course had
determined to play for certain stakes, and the giant, being victorious, won the peasant’s
only son, whom he said he would come and claim on the morrow unless the parents could
hide him so cleverly that he could not be found.
</p>
<p>Knowing that such a feat would be impossible for them to perform, the parents fervently
prayed to Odin to help them, and in answer to their entreaties the god came down to
earth, and changed the boy into a tiny grain of wheat, which he hid in an ear of grain
in the midst of a large field, declaring that the giant would not be able to find
him. The giant Skrymsli, however, possessed wisdom far beyond what Odin imagined,
and, failing to find the child at home, he strode off immediately to the field with
his scythe, and mowing the wheat he selected the particular ear where the boy was
hidden. Counting over the grains of wheat he was about to lay his hand upon the right
one when Odin, hearing the child’s cry of distress, snatched the kernel out of the
giant’s hand, and restored the boy to his parents, telling them that he had done all
in his power to help them. But as the giant vowed he had been cheated, and would again
claim the boy on the morrow unless the parents could outwit him, the unfortunate <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>peasants now turned to Hoenir for aid. The god heard them graciously and changed the
boy into a fluff of down, which he hid in the breast of a swan swimming in a pond
close by. Now when, a few minutes later, Skrymsli came up, he guessed what had occurred,
and seizing the swan, he bit off its neck, and would have swallowed the down had not
Hoenir wafted it away from his lips and out of reach, restoring the boy safe and sound
to his parents, but telling them that he could not further aid them.
</p>
<p>Skrymsli warned the parents that he would make a third attempt to secure the child,
whereupon they applied in their despair to Loki, who carried the boy out to sea, and
concealed him, as a tiny egg, in the roe of a flounder. Returning from his expedition,
Loki encountered the giant near the shore, and seeing that he was bent upon a fishing
excursion, he insisted upon accompanying him. He felt somewhat uneasy lest the terrible
giant should have seen through his device, and therefore thought it would be well
for him to be on the spot in case of need. Skrymsli baited his hook, and was more
or less successful in his angling, when suddenly he drew up the identical flounder
in which Loki had concealed his little charge. Opening the fish upon his knee, the
giant proceeded to minutely examine the roe, until he found the egg which he was seeking.
</p>
<p>The plight of the boy was certainly perilous, but Loki, watching his chance, snatched
the egg out of the giant’s grasp, and transforming it again into the child, he instructed
him secretly to run home, passing through the boathouse on his way and closing the
door behind him. The terrified boy did as he was told immediately he found himself
on land, and the giant, quick to observe his flight, dashed after him into the boathouse.
Now Loki had cunningly placed a sharp spike in such a position <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>that the great head of the giant ran full tilt against it, and he sank to the ground
with a groan, whereupon Loki, seeing him helpless, cut off one of his legs. Imagine
the god’s dismay, however, when he saw the pieces join and immediately knit together.
But Loki was a master of guile, and recognising this as the work of magic, he cut
off the other leg, promptly throwing flint and steel between the severed limb and
trunk, and thereby hindering any further sorcery. The peasants were immensely relieved
to find that their enemy was slain, and ever after they considered Loki the mightiest
of all the heavenly council, for he had delivered them effectually from their foe,
while the other gods had lent only temporary aid.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Notwithstanding their wonderful bridge Bifröst, the tremulous way, and the watchfulness
of Heimdall, the gods could not feel entirely secure in Asgard, and were often fearful
lest the frost giants should make their way into Asgard. To obviate this possibility,
they finally decided to build an impregnable fortress; and while they were planning
how this could be done, an unknown architect came with an offer to undertake the construction,
provided the gods would give him sun, moon, and Freya, goddess of youth and beauty,
as reward. The gods were wroth at so presumptuous an offer, but when they would have
indignantly driven the stranger from their presence, Loki urged them to make a bargain
which it would be impossible for the stranger to keep, and so they finally told the
architect that the guerdon should be his, provided the fortress were finished in the
course of a single winter, and that he accomplished the work with no other assistance
than that of his horse Svadilfare.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The unknown architect agreed to these seemingly impossible conditions, and immediately
set to work, hauling ponderous blocks of stone by night, building during the day,
and progressing so rapidly that the gods began to feel somewhat anxious. Ere long
they noticed that more than half the labour was accomplished by the wonderful steed
Svadilfare, and when they saw, near the end of winter, that the work was finished
save only one portal, which they knew the architect could easily erect during the
night:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p>Terrified lest they should be called upon to part, not only with the sun and moon,
but also with Freya, the personification of the youth and beauty of the world, the
gods turned upon Loki, and threatened to kill him unless he devised some means of
hindering the architect from finishing the work within the specified time.
</p>
<p>Loki’s cunning proved once more equal to the situation. He waited until nightfall
of the final day, when, as Svadilfare passed the fringe of a forest, painfully dragging
one of the great blocks of stone required for <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>the termination of the work, he rushed out from a dark glade in the guise of a mare,
and neighed so invitingly that, in a trice, the horse kicked himself free of his harness
and ran after the mare, closely pursued by his angry master. The mare galloped swiftly
on, artfully luring horse and master deeper and deeper into the forest shades, until
the night was nearly gone, and it was no longer possible to finish the work. The architect
was none other than a redoubtable Hrim-thurs, in disguise, and he now returned to
Asgard in a towering rage at the fraud which had been practised upon him. Assuming
his wonted proportions, he would have annihilated the gods had not Thor suddenly returned
from a journey and slain him with his magic hammer Miölnir, which he hurled with terrific
force full in his face.
</p>
<p>The gods had saved themselves on this occasion only by fraud and by the violent deed
of Thor, and these were destined to bring great sorrow upon them, and eventually to
secure their downfall, and to hasten the coming of Ragnarok. Loki, however, felt no
remorse for his part, and in due time, it is said, he became the parent of an eight-footed
steed called Sleipnir, which, as we have seen, was Odin’s favourite mount.

of “prince of lies.”

<h3 class="main">The Pursuit of Loki</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Knowing that he could now have no hope of being <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>admitted into Asgard again, and that sooner or later the gods, seeing the effect of
his evil deeds, would regret having permitted him to roam the world, and would try
either to bind or slay him, Loki withdrew to the mountains, where he built himself
a hut, with four doors which he always left wide open to permit of a hasty escape.
Carefully laying his plans, he decided that if the gods should come in search of him
he would rush down to the neighbouring cataract, according to tradition the Fraananger
force or stream, and, changing himself into a salmon, would thus evade his pursuers.
He reasoned, however, that although he could easily avoid any hook, it might be difficult
for him to effect his escape if the gods should fashion a net like that of the sea-goddess
Ran.
</p>
<p>Haunted by this fear, he decided to test the possibility of making such a mesh, and
started to make one out of twine. He was still engaged upon the task when Odin, Kvasir,
and Thor suddenly appeared in the distance; and knowing that they had discovered his
retreat, Loki threw his half-finished net into the fire, and, rushing through one
of his ever-open doors, he leaped into the waterfall, where, in the shape of a salmon,
he hid among some stones in the bed of the stream.
</p>
<p>The gods, finding the hut empty, were about to depart, when Kvasir perceived the remains
of the burnt net on the hearth. After some thought an inspiration came to him, and
he advised the gods to weave a similar implement and use it in searching for their
foe in the neighbouring stream, since it would be like Loki to choose such a method
of baffling their pursuit. This advice seemed good and was immediately followed, and,
the net finished, the gods proceeded to drag the stream. Loki eluded the net at its
first cast <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>by hiding at the bottom of the river between two stones; and when the gods weighted
the mesh and tried a second time, he effected his escape by jumping up stream. A third
attempt to secure him proved successful, however, for, as he once more tried to get
away by a sudden leap, Thor caught him in mid-air and held him so fast, that he could
not escape. The salmon, whose slipperiness is proverbial in the North, is noted for
its remarkably slim tail, and Norsemen attribute this to Thor’s tight grasp upon his
foe.

wolf for the purpose. One of these fetters was passed under Loki’s shoulders, and
one under his loins, thereby securing him firmly hand and foot; but the gods, not

</p>
<p>When Ymir, the first giant, fell lifeless on the ice, slain by the gods, his progeny
were drowned in his blood. One couple only, Bergelmir and his wife, effected their
escape to Jötun-heim, where they took up their abode and became the parents of all
the giant race. In the North the giants were called by various names, each having
a particular meaning. Jötun, for instance, meant “the great eater,” for the giants
were noted for their enormous appetites as well as for their uncommon size. They were
fond of drinking as well as of eating, wherefore they were also called Thurses, a
word which some writers claim had the same meaning as thirst; but others think they
owed this name to the high towers (“turseis”) which they were supposed to have built.
As the giants were antagonistic to the gods, the latter always strove to force them
to remain in Jötun-heim, <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>which was situated in the cold regions of the Pole. The giants were almost invariably
worsted in their encounters with the gods, for they were heavy and slow-witted, and
had nothing but stone weapons to oppose to the Æsir’s bronze. In spite of this inequality,
however, they were sometimes greatly envied by the gods, for they were thoroughly
conversant with all knowledge relating to the past. Even Odin was envious of this
attribute, and no sooner had he secured it by a draught from Mimir’s spring than he
hastened to Jötun-heim to measure himself against Vafthrudnir, the most learned of
the giant brood. But he might never have succeeded in defeating his antagonist in
this strange encounter had he not ceased inquiring about the past and propounded a
question relating to the future.
</p>
<p>Of all the gods Thor was most feared by the Jötuns, for he was continually waging
war against the frost and mountain giants, who would fain have bound the earth for
ever in their rigid bands, thus preventing men from tilling the soil. In fighting
against them, Thor, as we have already seen, generally had recourse to his terrible
hammer Miölnir.

<p>This belief led them to name one of their principal mountain chains the Riesengebirge
(giant mountains). The Scandinavians also shared this belief, and to this day the
Icelanders designate their highest mountain peaks by the name of Jokul, a modification
of the word “Jötun.” In Switzerland, where the everlasting snows rest upon the lofty
mountain tops, the people still relate old stories of the time when the giants roamed
abroad; and when an avalanche came crashing down the mountain side, they say the giants
have restlessly shaken off part of the icy burden from their brows and shoulders.

<p class="first">As the giants were also personifications of snow, ice, cold, stone, and subterranean
fire, they were said to be descended from the primitive Fornjotnr, whom some authorities
identify with Ymir. According to this version of the myth, Fornjotnr had three sons:
Hler, the sea; Kari, the air; and Loki, fire. These three divinities, the first gods,
formed the oldest trinity, and their respective descendants were the sea giants Mimir,
Gymir, and Grendel, the storm giants Thiassi, Thrym, and Beli, and the giants of fire
and death, such as the Fenris wolf and Hel.
</p>
<p>As all the royal dynasties claimed descent from some mythical being, the Merovingians
asserted that their first progenitor was a sea giant, who rose out of the waves in
the form of an ox, and surprised the queen while she was walking alone on the seashore,
compelling her to become his wife. She gave birth to a son named Meroveus, the founder
of the first dynasty of Frankish kings.

<p>Many stories have already been told about the most important giants. They reappear
in many of the later myths and fairy-tales, and manifest, after the introduction of
Christianity, a peculiar dislike to the sound of church bells and the singing of monks
and nuns.

<h3 class="main">The Giant in Love</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Scandinavians relate, in this connection, that in the days of Olaf the Saint a
giant called Senjemand, dwelt on the Island of Senjen, and he was greatly incensed
because a nun on the Island of Grypto daily sang her morning hymn. This giant fell
in love with a beautiful maiden called Juterna-jesta, and it was long ere he could
find courage to propose to her. When at last he made his halting request, the fair
damsel scornfully rejected him, declaring that he was far too old and ugly for her
taste.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Miserable Senjemand—ugly and grey!
</p>
<p class="line">Thou win the maid of Kvedfiord!
</p>
<p class="line">No—a churl thou art and shalt ever remain.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Ballad (Brace’s tr.).</i>
</p>
<p>In his anger at being thus scornfully refused, the giant swore vengeance, and soon
after he shot a great flint arrow from his bow at the maiden, who dwelt eighty miles
away. Another lover, Torge, also a giant, seeing her peril and wishing to protect
her, flung his hat at the speeding arrow. This hat was a thousand feet high and proportionately
broad and thick, nevertheless the arrow pierced the headgear, falling short, however,
of its aim. Senjemand, seeing that he had failed, and fearing the wrath of Torge,
mounted his steed and prepared to ride off as quickly as possible; but the sun, rising
just then above the <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>horizon, turned him into stone, together with the arrow and Torge’s hat, the huge
pile being known as the Torghatten mountain. The people still point to an obelisk
which they say is the stone arrow; to a hole in the mountain, 289 feet high and 88
feet wide, which they say is the aperture made by the arrow in its flight through
the hat; and to the horseman on Senjen Island, apparently riding a colossal steed
and drawing the folds of his wide cavalry cloak closely about him. As for the nun
whose singing had so disturbed Senjemand, she was petrified too, and never troubled
any one with her psalmody again.

<h3 class="main">The Giant and the Church Bells</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another legend relates that one of the mountain giants, annoyed by the ringing of
church bells more than fifty miles away, once caught up a huge rock, which he hurled
at the sacred building. Fortunately it fell short and broke in two. Ever since then,
the peasants say that the trolls come on Christmas Eve to raise the largest piece
of stone upon golden pillars, and to dance and feast beneath it. A lady, wishing to
know whether this tale were true, once sent her groom to the place. The trolls came
forward and hospitably offered him a drink from a horn mounted in gold and ornamented
with runes. Seizing the horn, the groom flung its contents away and dashed off with
it at a mad gallop, closely pursued by the trolls, from whom he escaped only by passing
through a stubble field and over running water. Some of their number visited the lady
on the morrow to claim this horn, and when she refused to part with it they laid a
curse upon her, declaring that her castle would be burned down every time the horn
should be removed. The prediction has thrice been fulfilled, and now the family guard
<span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>the relic with superstitious care. A similar drinking vessel, obtained in much the
same fashion by the Oldenburg family, is exhibited in the collection of the King of
Denmark.
</p>
<p>The giants were not supposed to remain stationary, but were said to move about in
the darkness, sometimes transporting masses of earth and sand, which they dropped
here and there. The sandhills in northern Germany and Denmark were supposed to have
been thus formed.

<h3 class="main">The Giants’ Ship</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A North Frisian tradition relates that the giants possessed a colossal ship, called
Mannigfual, which constantly cruised about in the Atlantic Ocean. Such was the size
of this vessel that the captain was said to patrol the deck on horseback, while the
rigging was so extensive and the masts so high that the sailors who went up as youths
came down as gray-haired men, having rested and refreshed themselves in rooms fashioned
and provisioned for that purpose in the huge blocks and pulleys.
</p>
<p>By some mischance it happened that the pilot once directed the immense vessel into
the North Sea, and wishing to return to the Atlantic as soon as possible, yet not
daring to turn in such a small space, he steered into the English Channel. Imagine
the dismay of all on board when they saw the passage growing narrower and narrower
the farther they advanced. When they came to the narrowest spot, between Calais and
Dover, it seemed barely possible that the vessel, drifting along with the current,
could force its way through. The captain, with laudable presence of mind, promptly
bade his men soap the sides of the ship, and to lay an extra-thick layer on the starboard,
where the rugged cliffs of <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>Dover rose threateningly. These orders were no sooner carried out than the vessel
entered the narrow space, and, thanks to the captain’s precaution, it slipped safely
through. The rocks of Dover scraped off so much soap, however, that ever since they
have been particularly white, and the waves dashing against them still have an unusually
foamy appearance.
</p>
<p>This exciting experience was not the only one through which the Mannigfual passed,
for we are told that it once, nobody knows how, penetrated into the Baltic Sea, where,
the water not being deep enough to keep the vessel afloat, the captain ordered all
the ballast to be thrown overboard. The material thus cast on either side of the vessel
into the sea formed the two islands of Bornholm and Christiansoë.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Thuringia and in the Black Forest the stories of the giants are legion, and one
of the favourites with the peasants is that about Ilse, the lovely daughter of the
giant of the Ilsenstein. She was so charming that far and wide she was known as the
Beautiful Princess Ilse, and was wooed by many knights, of whom she preferred the
Lord of Westerburg. But her father did not at all approve of her consorting with a
mere mortal, and forbade her to see her lover. Princess Ilse was wilful, however,
and in spite of her sire’s prohibition she daily visited her lover. The giant, exasperated
by her persistency and disobedience, finally stretched out his huge hands and, seizing
the rocks, tore a great gap between the height where he dwelt and the castle of Westerburg.
Upon this, Princess Ilse, going to the cleft which parted her from her lover, recklessly
flung herself over the precipice into the raging flood beneath, and was there changed
into <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>a bewitching undine. She dwelt in the limpid waters for many a year, appearing from
time to time to exercise her fascinations upon mortals, and even, it is said, captivating
the affections of the Emperor Henry, who paid frequent visits to her cascade. Her
last appearance, according to popular belief, was at Pentecost, a hundred years ago;
and the natives have not yet ceased to look for the beautiful princess, who is said
still to haunt the stream and to wave her white arms to entice travellers into the
cool spray of the waterfall.

with reluctance that they made way for the human race, and retreated into the waste
and barren parts of the country, where they brought up their families in strict seclusion.
Such was the ignorance of their offspring, that a young giantess, straying from home,
once came to an inhabited valley, where for the first time in her life she saw a farmer
ploughing on the hillside. Deeming him a pretty plaything, she caught him up with
his team, <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>and thrusting them into her apron, she gleefully carried them home to exhibit to her
father. But the giant immediately bade her carry peasant and horses back to the place
where she had found them, and when she had done so he sadly explained that the creatures
whom she took for mere playthings, would eventually drive the giant folk away, and
become masters of the earth.

like maggots in the flesh of the slain giant Ymir. The gods, perceiving these tiny,
unformed creatures creeping in and out, gave them form and features, and they became
known as dark elves, on account of their swarthy complexions. These small beings were
so homely, with their dark skin, green eyes, large heads, short legs, and crow’s feet,
that they were enjoined to hide underground, being commanded never to show themselves
during the daytime lest they should be turned into stone. Although less powerful than
the gods, they were far more intelligent than men, and as their knowledge was boundless
and extended even to the future, gods and men were equally anxious to question them.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Helva, daughter of the Lord of Nesvek, was loved by Esbern Snare, whose suit, however,
was rejected by the proud father with the scornful words: “When thou shalt build at
Kallundborg a stately church, then will I give thee Helva to wife.”
</p>
<p>Now Esbern, although of low estate, was proud of heart, even as the lord, and he determined,
come what might, to find a way to win his coveted bride. So off he strode to a troll
in Ullshoi Hill, and effected a bargain whereby the troll undertook to build a fine
church, on completion of which Esbern was to tell the builder’s name or forfeit his
eyes and heart.
</p>
<p>Night and day the troll wrought on, and as the building took shape, sadder grew Esbern
Snare. He listened at the crevices of the hill by night; he watched during the day;
he wore himself to a shadow by anxious thought; he besought the elves to aid him.
All to no purpose. Not a sound did he hear, not a thing did he see, to suggest the
name of the builder.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime, rumour was busy, and the fair Helva, hearing of the evil compact, prayed
for the soul of the unhappy man.
</p>
<p>Time passed until one day the church lacked only one pillar, and worn out by black
despair, Esbern sank exhausted upon a bank, whence he heard the troll hammering the
last stone in the quarry underground. “Fool that I am,” he said bitterly, “I have
builded my tomb.”
</p>
<p>Just then he heard a light footstep, and looking up, he beheld his beloved. “Would
that I might die in thy stead,” said she, through her tears, and with that Esbern
confessed how that for love of her he had imperilled eyes and heart and soul.
</p>
<p>Then fast as the troll hammered underground, Helva prayed beside her lover, and the
prayers of the maiden prevailed over the spell of the troll, for suddenly Esbern caught
the sound of a troll-wife singing to her infant, bidding it be comforted, for that,
on the morrow, <i>Father Fine</i> would return bringing a mortal’s eyes and heart.
</p>
<p>Sure of his victim, the troll hurried to Kallundborg with the last stone. “Too late,
Fine!” quoth Esbern, and at the word, the troll vanished with his stone, and it is
said that the peasants heard at night the sobbing of a woman underground, and the
voice of the troll loud with blame.

<h3 class="main">The Magic of the Dwarfs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dwarfs, as well as the elves, were ruled by a king, who, in various countries
of northern Europe, was known as Andvari, Alberich, Elbegast, Gondemar, Laurin, or
Oberon. He dwelt in a magnificent subterranean palace, studded with the gems which
his subjects had mined from the bosom of the earth, and, besides untold riches and
the Tarnkappe, he owned a magic ring, an invincible sword, and a belt of strength.
At his command the little men, who were very clever smiths, would fashion marvellous
jewels or weapons, which their ruler would bestow upon favourite mortals.
</p>
<p>We have already seen how the dwarfs fashioned Sif’s golden hair, the ship Skidbladnir,
the point of Odin’s spear Gungnir, the ring Draupnir, the golden-bristled boar Gullin-bursti,
the hammer Miölnir, and Freya’s golden necklace Brisinga-men. They are also said to
have made the magic girdle which Spenser describes in his poem of the “Faerie Queene,”—a
girdle which was said to have the power of revealing whether its wearer were virtuous
or a hypocrite.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“That girdle gave the virtue of chaste love

</p>
<p class="line">But it would loose, or else asunder tear.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Faerie Queene (Spenser).</i>
</p>
<p>The dwarfs also manufactured the mythical sword Tyrfing, which could cut through iron
and stone, and which they gave to Angantyr. This sword, like Frey’s, fought of its
own accord, and could not be sheathed, after it was once drawn, until it had tasted
blood. Angantyr was so proud of this weapon that he had it buried with him; but his
daughter Hervor visited his <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>tomb at midnight, recited magic spells, and forced him to rise from his grave to give
her the precious blade. She wielded it bravely, and it eventually became the property
of another of the Northern heroes.
</p>
<p>Another famous weapon, which according to tradition was forged by the dwarfs in Eastern
lands, was the sword Angurvadel which Frithiof received as a portion of his inheritance
from his fathers. Its hilt was of hammered gold, and the blade was inscribed with
runes which were dull until it was brandished in war, when they flamed red as the
comb of the fighting-cock.

worshipped in the Northlands, the dwarfs withdrew entirely from the country, and a
ferryman related how he had been hired by a mysterious personage to ply his boat back
and forth across the river one night, and at every trip his vessel was so heavily
laden with invisible passengers that it nearly sank. When his night’s work was over,
he received a rich reward, and his employer informed him that he had carried the dwarfs

tried to improve their race by winning human wives or by stealing unbaptized children,

To recover possession of her own babe, and to rid herself of the changeling, a woman
was obliged either to brew beer in egg-shells or to grease the soles of the child’s
feet and hold them so near the flames that, attracted by their offspring’s distressed
cries, the dwarf parents would hasten to claim their own and return the stolen child.

<p class="first">Besides the dwarfs there was another numerous class of tiny creatures called Lios-alfar,
<span class="corr" id="xd32e5751" title="Source: lightor">light or</span> white elves, who inhabited the realms of air between heaven and earth, and were gently
governed by the genial god Frey from his palace in Alf-heim. They were lovely, beneficent
beings, so pure and innocent that, according to some authorities, their name was derived
from the same root as the Latin word “white” (<i>albus</i>), which, in a modified form, was given to the snow-covered Alps, and to Albion (England),
because of her white chalk cliffs which could be seen afar.

<p>The elves were so small that they could flit about unseen while they tended the flowers,
birds, and butterflies; and as they were passionately fond of dancing, they often
glided down to earth on a moonbeam, to dance on the green. Holding one another by
the hand, they would dance in circles, thereby making the “fairy rings,” which were
to be discerned by the deeper green and greater luxuriance of the grass which their
little feet had pressed.

a story is told of how Sir Olaf, riding off to his <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>wedding, was enticed by the fairies into their ring. On the morrow, instead of a merry

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These elves, who in England were called fairies or fays, were also enthusiastic musicians,
and delighted especially in a certain air known as the elf-dance, which was so irresistible
that no one who heard it could refrain from dancing. If a mortal, overhearing the
air, ventured to reproduce it, he suddenly found himself incapable of stopping and
was forced to play on and on until he died of exhaustion, unless he were deft enough
to play the tune backwards, or some one charitably cut the strings of his violin.
His hearers, who were forced to dance as long as the tones continued, could only stop
when they ceased.

<p class="first">In later times the fairies or elves were said to be ruled by the king of the dwarfs,
who, being an underground spirit, was considered a demon, and allowed to retain the
magic power which the missionaries had wrested from the god Frey. In England and France
the king of the fairies was known by the name of Oberon; he governed fairyland with
his queen Titania, and the highest revels on earth were held on Midsummer night. It
was then that the fairies all congregated around him and danced most merrily.

<p>These elves, like the brownies, Huldra folk, kobolds, etc., were also supposed to

a farmer descried them he declared that his steeds had been elf-ridden during the

<p class="first">In Scandinavia and Germany sacrifices were offered to the elves to make them propitious.
These sacrifices <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>consisted of some small animal, or of a bowl of honey and milk, and were known as
Alf-blot. They were quite common until the missionaries taught the people that the
elves were mere demons, when they were transferred to the angels, who were long entreated
to befriend mortals, and propitiated by the same gifts.
</p>
<p>Many of the elves were supposed to live and die with the trees and plants which they
tended, but these moss, wood, or tree maidens, while remarkably beautiful when seen
in front, were hollow like a trough when viewed from behind. They appear in many of
the popular tales, but almost always as benevolent and helpful spirits, for they were
anxious to do good to mortals and to cultivate friendly relations with them.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Scandinavia the elves, both light and dark, were worshipped as household divinities,
and their images were carved on the doorposts. The Norsemen, who were driven from
home by the tyranny of Harald Harfager in 874, took their carved doorposts with them
upon their ships. Similar carvings, including images of the gods and heroes, decorated
the pillars of their high seats which they also carried away. The exiles showed their
trust in their gods by throwing these wooden images overboard when they neared the
Icelandic shores and settling where the waves carried the posts, even if the spot
scarcely seemed the most desirable. “Thus they carried with them the religion, the
poetry, and the laws of their race, and on this desolate volcanic island they kept
these records unchanged for hundreds of years, while other Teutonic nations gradually
became affected by their intercourse with Roman and Byzantine Christianity.” These
records, carefully collected by Sæmund the learned, form the <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>Elder Edda, the most precious relic of ancient Northern literature, without which
we should know comparatively little of the religion of our forefathers.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of the Volsungs begins with Sigi, a son of Odin, a powerful man, and generally
respected, until he killed a man from motives of jealousy, the latter having slain
more game when they were out hunting together. In consequence of this crime, Sigi
was driven from his own land and declared an outlaw. But it seems that he had not
entirely forfeited Odin’s favour, <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>for the god now provided him with a well-equipped vessel, together with a number of
brave followers, and promised that victory should ever attend him.
</p>
<p>Thus aided by Odin, the raids of Sigi became a terror to his foes, and in the end
he won the glorious empire of the Huns and for many years reigned as a powerful monarch.
But in extreme old age his fortune changed, Odin forsook him, his wife’s kindred fell
upon him, and he was slain in a treacherous encounter.

<p class="first">His death was soon avenged, however, for Rerir, his son, returning from an expedition
upon which he had been absent from the land at the time, put the murderers to death
as his first act upon mounting the throne. The rule of Rerir was marked by every sign
of prosperity, but his dearest wish, a son to succeed him, remained unfulfilled for
many a year. Finally, however, Frigga decided to grant his constant prayer, and to
vouchsafe the heir he longed for. She accordingly despatched her swift messenger Gna,
or Liod, with a miraculous apple, which she dropped into his lap as he was sitting
alone on the hillside. Glancing upward, Rerir recognised the emissary of the goddess,
and joyfully hastened home to partake of the apple with his wife. The child who in
due time was born under these favourable auspices was a handsome little lad. His parents
called him Volsung, and while he was still a mere infant they both died, and the child
became ruler of the land.

<p class="first">Years passed and Volsung’s wealth and power ever increased. He was the boldest leader,
and rallied many <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>brave warriors around him. Full oft did they drink his mead underneath the Branstock,
a mighty oak, which, rising in the middle of his hall, pierced the roof and overshadowed
the whole house.

Volsung’s consent, although Signy had never seen him.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the wedding feast was in progress, and when the merry-making was at its height,
the entrance to the hall was suddenly darkened by the tall form of a one-eyed man,
closely enveloped in a mantle of cloudy blue. Without vouchsafing word or glance to
any in the assembly, the stranger strode to the Branstock and <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>thrust a glittering sword up to the hilt in its great bole. Then, turning slowly round,
he faced the awe-struck and silent assembly, and declared that the weapon would be
for the warrior who could pull it out of its oaken sheath, and that it would assure
him victory in every battle. The words ended, he then passed out as he had entered,
and disappeared, leaving a conviction in the minds of all that Odin, king of the gods,
had been in their midst.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,
</p>
<p class="line">That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream
</p>
<p class="line">We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end

<p class="line">And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;

<p class="line">For they knew that the gift was Odin’s, a sword for the world to praise.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Volsung was the first to recover the power of speech, and, waiving his own right first
to essay the feat, he invited Siggeir to make the first attempt to draw the divine
weapon out of the tree-trunk. The bridegroom anxiously tugged and strained, but the
sword remained firmly embedded in the oak and he resumed his seat, with an air of
chagrin. Then Volsung tried, with the same result. The weapon was evidently not intended
for either of them, and the young Volsung princes were next invited to try their strength.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The nine eldest sons were equally unsuccessful; but when Sigmund, the tenth and youngest,
laid his firm young hand upon the hilt, the sword yielded easily to <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>his touch, and he triumphantly drew it out as though it had merely been sheathed in
its scabbard.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,
</p>
<p class="line">And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,
</p>
<p class="line">Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought;
</p>
<p class="line">When, lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,
</p>
<p class="line">For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out
</p>
<p class="line">As high o’er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away
</p>
<p class="line">From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose it lay.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Nearly all present were gratified at the success of the young prince; but Siggeir’s
heart was filled with envy, and he coveted possession of the weapon. He offered to
purchase it from his young brother-in-law, but Sigmund refused to part with it at
any price, declaring that it was clear that the weapon had been intended for him to
wear. This refusal so offended Siggeir that he secretly resolved to exterminate the
proud Volsungs, and to secure the divine sword at the same time that he indulged his
hatred towards his new kinsmen.
</p>
<p>Concealing his chagrin, however, he turned to Volsung and cordially invited him to
visit his court a month later, together with his sons and kinsmen. The invitation
was immediately accepted, and although Signy, suspecting evil, secretly sought her
father while her husband slept, and implored him to retract his promise and stay at
home, he would not consent to withdraw his plighted word and so exhibit fear.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few weeks after the return of the bridal couple, therefore, Volsung’s well-manned
vessels arrived within sight of Siggeir’s shores. Signy had been keeping anxious watch,
and when she perceived them she hastened <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>down to the beach to implore her kinsmen not to land, warning them that her husband
had treacherously planned an ambush, whence they could not escape alive. But Volsung
and his sons, whom no peril could daunt, calmly bade her return to her husband’s palace,
and donning their arms they boldly set foot ashore.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then sweetly Volsung kissed her: ‘Woe am I for thy sake,
</p>
<p class="line">But Earth the word hath hearkened, that yet unborn I spake;
</p>
<p class="line">How I ne’er would turn me backward from the sword or fire of bale;
</p>
<p class="line">—I have held that word till to-day, and to-day shall I change the tale?
</p>
<p class="line">And look on these thy brethren, how goodly and great are they,
</p>
<p class="line">Wouldst thou have the maidens mock them, when this pain hath passed away
</p>
<p class="line">And they sit at the feast hereafter, that they feared the deadly stroke?
</p>
<p class="line">Let us do our day’s work deftly for the praise and glory of folk;
</p>
<p class="line">And if the Norns will have it that the Volsung kin shall fail,
</p>
<p class="line">Yet I know of the deed that dies not, and the name that shall ever avail.’ ”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It befell as Signy had said, for on their way to the palace the brave little troop
fell into Siggeir’s ambush, and, although they fought with heroic courage, they were
so borne down by the superior number of their foes that Volsung was slain and all
his sons were made captive. The young men were led bound into the presence of the
cowardly Siggeir, who had taken no part in the fight, and Sigmund was forced to relinquish
his precious sword, after which he and his brothers were condemned to death.
</p>
<p>Signy, hearing the cruel sentence, vainly interceded for her brothers: all she could
obtain by her prayers and entreaties was that they should be chained to a fallen oak
in the forest, to perish of hunger and thirst if the wild beasts should spare them.
Then, lest she <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>should visit and succour her brothers, Siggeir confined his wife in the palace, where
she was closely guarded night and day.
</p>
<p>Every morning early Siggeir himself sent a messenger into the forest to see whether
the Volsungs were still living, and every morning the man returned saying a monster
had come during the night and had devoured one of the princes, leaving nothing but
his bones. At last, when none but Sigmund remained alive, Signy thought of a plan,
and she prevailed on one of her servants to carry some honey into the forest and smear
it over her brother’s face and mouth.
</p>
<p>When the wild beast came that night, attracted by the smell of the honey, it licked
Sigmund’s face, and even thrust its tongue into his mouth. Clinching his teeth upon
it, Sigmund, weak and wounded as he was, held on to the animal, and in its frantic
struggles his bonds gave way, and he succeeded in slaying the prowling beast who had
devoured his brothers. Then he vanished into the forest, where he remained concealed
until the king’s messenger had come as usual, and until Signy, released from captivity,
came speeding to the forest to weep over her kinsmen’s remains.
</p>
<p>Seeing her intense grief, and knowing that she had not participated in Siggeir’s cruelty,
Sigmund stole out of his place of concealment and comforted her as best he could.
Together they then buried the whitening bones, and Sigmund registered a solemn oath
to avenge his family’s wrongs. This vow was fully approved by Signy, who, however,
bade her brother bide a favourable time, promising to send him aid. Then the brother
and sister sadly parted, she to return to her distasteful palace home, and he to a
remote part of the forest, where he built a tiny hut and plied the craft of a smith.

he proudly watched the growth of his eldest son, whom Signy secretly sent to her brother
when he was ten years of age, that Sigmund might train up the child to help him to
obtain vengeance if he should prove worthy. Sigmund reluctantly accepted the charge;
but as soon as he had tested the boy he found him deficient in physical courage, so
he either sent him back to his mother, or, as some versions relate, slew him.
</p>
<p>Some time after this Signy’s second son was sent into the forest for the same purpose,
but Sigmund found him equally lacking in courage. Evidently none but a pure-blooded
Volsung would avail for the grim work of revenge, and Signy, realising this, resolved
to commit a crime.

days later she disappeared from the hut, and, returning to the palace, she resumed
her own form, and when she next gave birth to a son, she rejoiced to see in his bold

<p class="first">When Sinfiotli, as the child was called, was ten years of age, she herself made a
preliminary test of his courage by sewing his garment to his skin, and then suddenly
snatching it off, and as the brave boy did not so much as wince, but laughed aloud,
she confidently sent him to the forest hut. Sigmund speedily prepared his usual test,
and ere leaving the hut one day he bade Sinfiotli take meal from a certain sack, and
knead it and bake some bread. On returning home, Sigmund asked whether his orders
had been carried out. The lad replied by showing the bread, and when closely questioned
he artlessly confessed that he had been obliged to knead into the loaf a great adder
which was hidden in the meal. Pleased to see that the boy, for whom he felt a strange
affection, had successfully stood the test which had daunted his brothers, Sigmund
bade him refrain from eating of the loaf, for although he was proof against the bite
of a reptile, he could not, like his mentor, taste poison unharmed.

<p class="first">Sigmund now began patiently to teach Sinfiotli all <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>that a warrior of the North should know, and the two soon became inseparable companions.
One day while ranging the forest together they came to a hut, where they found two
men sound asleep. Near by hung two wolf-skins, which suggested immediately that the
strangers were werewolves, whom a cruel spell prevented from bearing their natural
form save for a short space at a time. Prompted by curiosity, Sigmund and Sinfiotli
donned the wolf-skins, and they were soon, in the guise of wolves, rushing through
the forest, slaying and devouring all that came in their way.
</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>Such were their wolfish passions that soon they attacked each other, and after a fierce
struggle Sinfiotli, the younger and weaker, fell dead. This catastrophe brought Sigmund
to his senses, and he hung over his murdered companion in despair. While thus engaged
he saw two weasels come out of the forest and attack each other fiercely until one
lay dead. The victor then sprang into the thicket, to return with a leaf, which it
laid upon its companion’s breast. Then was seen a marvellous thing, for at the touch
of the magic herb the dead beast came back to life. A moment later a raven flying
overhead dropped a similar leaf at Sigmund’s feet, and he, understanding that the
gods wished to help him, laid it upon Sinfiotli, who was at once restored to life.
</p>
<p>In dire fear lest they might work each other further mischief, Sigmund and Sinfiotli
now crept home and patiently waited until the time of their release should come. To
their great relief the skins dropped off on the ninth night, and they hastily flung
them into the fire, where they were entirely consumed, and the spell was broken for
ever.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sigmund now confided the story of his wrongs to Sinfiotli, who swore that, although
Siggeir was his father (for neither he nor Sigmund knew the secret of his birth),
he would aid him in his revenge. At nightfall, therefore, he accompanied Sigmund to
the king’s hall, and they entered unseen, concealing themselves in the cellar, behind
the huge vats of beer. Here they were discovered by Signy’s two youngest children,
who, while playing with golden rings, which rolled into the cellar, came suddenly
upon the men in ambush.
</p>
<p>They loudly proclaimed their discovery to their father and his guests, but, before
Siggeir and his men could take up arms, Signy took both children, and dragging them
into the cellar bade her brother slay the little traitors. This Sigmund utterly refused
to do, but Sinfiotli struck off their heads ere he turned to fight against the assailants,
who were now closing in upon them.
</p>
<p>In spite of all efforts Sigmund and his brave young companion soon fell into the hands
of the Goths, whereupon Siggeir sentenced them to be buried alive in the same mound,
with a stone partition between them so that they could neither see nor touch each
other. The prisoners were accordingly confined in their living grave, and their foes
were about to place the last stones on the roof, when Signy drew near, bearing a bundle
of straw, which she was allowed to throw at Sinfiotli’s feet, for the Goths fancied
that it contained only a few provisions which would prolong his agony without helping
him to escape.
</p>
<p>When all was still, Sinfiotli undid the sheaf, and great was his joy when he found
instead of bread the sword which Odin had given to Sigmund. Knowing <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>that nothing could dull or break the keen edge of this fine weapon, Sinfiotli thrust
it through the stone partition, and, aided by Sigmund, he succeeded in cutting an
opening, and in the end both effected their escape through the roof.

themselves on either side of the entrance, they prevented all but the women from passing

<p class="first">The long-planned vengeance for the slaughter of the Volsungs having thus been carried
out, Sigmund, feeling that nothing now detained him in the land of <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>the Goths, set sail with Sinfiotli and returned to Hunaland, where he was warmly welcomed
to the seat of power under the shade of his ancestral tree, the mighty Branstock.
When his authority was fully established, Sigmund married Borghild, a beautiful princess,
who bore him two sons, Hamond and Helgi. The latter was visited by the Norns as he
lay in his cradle, and they promised him sumptuous entertainment in Valhalla when
his earthly career should be ended.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“And the woman was fair and lovely and bore him sons of fame;

<p class="line">Men called them Hamond and Helgi, and when Helgi first saw light,

</p>
<p class="line">And called him Sunlit Hill, Sharp Sword, and Land of Rings,
</p>
<p class="line">And bade him be lovely and great, and a joy in the tale of kings.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Northern kings generally entrusted their sons’ upbringing to a stranger, for they
thought that so they would be treated with less indulgence than at home. Accordingly
Helgi was fostered by Hagal, and under his care the young prince became so fearless
that at the age of fifteen he ventured alone into the hall of Hunding, with whose
race his family was at feud. Passing through the hall unmolested and unrecognised,
he left an insolent message, which so angered Hunding that he immediately set out
in pursuit of the bold young prince, whom he followed to the dwelling of Hagal. Helgi
would then have been secured but that meanwhile he had disguised himself as a servant-maid,
and was busy grinding corn as if this were his wonted occupation. The invaders marvelled
somewhat at the maid’s tall stature and brawny arms, nevertheless they departed without
suspecting that they had been so near the hero whom they sought.
</p>
<p>Having thus cleverly escaped, Helgi joined Sinfiotli, <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>and collecting an army, the two young men marched boldly against the Hundings, with
whom they fought a great battle, over which the Valkyrs hovered, waiting to convey
the slain to Valhalla. Gudrun, one of the battle-maidens, was so struck by the courage
which Helgi displayed, that she openly sought him and promised to be his wife. Only
one of the Hunding race, Dag, remained alive, and he was allowed to go free after
promising not to endeavour to avenge his kinsmen’s death. This promise was not kept,
however, and Dag, having obtained possession of Odin’s spear Gungnir, treacherously
slew Helgi with it. Gudrun, who in the meantime had fulfilled her promise to become
his wife, wept many tears at his death, and laid a solemn curse upon his murderer;
then, hearing from one of her maids that her slain husband kept calling for her from
the depths of the tomb, she fearlessly entered the mound at night and tenderly inquired
why he called and why his wounds continued to bleed after death. Helgi answered that
he could not rest happy because of her grief, and declared that for every tear she
shed a drop of his blood must flow.

over Bifröst and entered Valhalla, <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>to become leader of the Einheriar, he was joined by Gudrun who, as a Valkyr once more,
resumed her loving tendance of him. When at Odin’s command she left his side for scenes
of human strife, it was to seek new recruits for the army which her lord was to lead

<p class="first">Sinfiotli, Sigmund’s eldest son, also met an early death; for, having slain in a quarrel
the brother of Borghild, she determined to poison him. Twice Sinfiotli detected the
attempt and told his father that there was poison in his cup. Twice Sigmund, whom
no venom could injure, drained the bowl; and when Borghild made a third attempt, he
bade Sinfiotli let the wine flow through his beard. Mistaking the meaning of his father’s
words, Sinfiotli forthwith drained the cup, and fell lifeless to the ground, for the
poison was of the most deadly kind.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“He drank as he spake the word, and forthwith the venom ran
</p>
<p class="line">In a chill flood over his heart and down fell the mighty man
</p>
<p class="line">With never an uttered death-word and never a death-changed look,
</p>
<p class="line">And the floor of the hall of the Volsungs beneath his falling shook.
</p>
<p class="line">Then up rose the elder of days with a great and bitter cry,
</p>
<p class="line">And lifted the head of the fallen; and none durst come anigh
</p>
<p class="line">To hearken the words of his sorrow, if any words he said
</p>
<p class="line">But such as the Father of all men might speak over Baldur dead.
</p>
<p class="line">And again, as before the death-stroke, waxed the hall of the Volsungs dim,

<p class="line">And once more he seemed in the forest, where he spake with nought but him.”</p>

<p class="first">Speechless with grief, Sigmund tenderly raised his son’s body in his arms, and strode
out of the hall and <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>down to the shore, where he deposited his precious burden in a skiff which an old
one-eyed boatman brought at his call. He would fain have stepped aboard also, but
ere he could do so the boatman pushed off and the frail craft was soon lost to sight.
The bereaved father then slowly wended his way home, taking comfort from the thought
that Odin himself had come to claim the young hero and had rowed away with him “out
into the west.”

<p class="first">Sigmund deposed Borghild as his wife and queen in punishment for this crime, and when
he was very old he sued for the hand of Hiordis, a fair young princess, daughter of
Eglimi, King of the Islands. This young maiden had many suitors, among others King
Lygni of Hunding’s race, but so great was Sigmund’s fame that she gladly accepted
him and became his wife. Lygni, the discarded suitor, was so angry at this decision,
that he immediately collected a great army and marched against his successful rival,
who, though overpowered by superior numbers, fought with the courage of despair.
</p>
<p>From the depths of a thicket which commanded the field of battle, Hiordis and her
maid anxiously watched the progress of the strife. They saw Sigmund pile the dead
around him, for none could stand against him, until at last a tall, one-eyed warrior
suddenly appeared, and the press of battle gave way before the terror of his presence.
</p>
<p>Without a moment’s pause the new champion aimed a fierce blow at Sigmund, which the
old hero parried with his sword. The shock shattered the matchless blade, and although
the strange assailant vanished as he had come, Sigmund was left defenceless and was
soon wounded unto death by his foes.

</p>
<p class="line">And he bore a mighty twi-bill, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,
</p>
<p class="line">And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite.

hiding-place in the thicket, and sought the spot where Sigmund lay all but dead. She
caught the stricken hero to her breast in a last passionate embrace, and then listened
tearfully while he bade her gather the fragments of his sword and carefully treasure

knew all things, his own fate not even excepted, for it had been revealed to him that
he would fall by the hand of a youth.

the smith’s craft, and the art of carving all manner of runes; he learned languages,
music, and eloquence; and, last but not least, he became a doughty warrior whom none
could subdue. When he had reached manhood Regin prompted him to ask the king for a
war-horse, a request which was immediately granted, and Gripir, the stud-keeper, was
bidden to allow him to choose <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>from the royal stables the steed which he most fancied.
</p>
<p>On his way to the meadow where the horses were at pasture, Sigurd met a one-eyed stranger,
clad in grey and blue, who accosted the young man and bade him drive the horses into
the river and select the one which could breast the tide with least difficulty.
</p>
<p>Sigurd received the advice gladly, and upon reaching the meadow he drove the horses
into the stream which flowed on one side. One of the number, after crossing, raced
round the opposite meadow; and, plunging again into the river, returned to his former
pasture without showing any signs of fatigue. Sigurd therefore did not hesitate to
select this horse, and he gave him the name of Grane or Greyfell. The steed was a
descendant of Odin’s eight-footed horse Sleipnir, and besides being unusually strong
and indefatigable, was as fearless as his master.

was gifted with a fearless soul and a powerful arm; Otter, the second, with snare
and net, and the power of changing his form at will; and Regin, the youngest, with
all wisdom and deftness of hand. To please the avaricious Hreidmar, this youngest
son fashioned for him a house lined with glittering gold and flashing gems, and this
was guarded by Fafnir, whose fierce glances and Ægis helmet none dared encounter.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span></p>

sun. This was none other than the dwarf king’s second son, Otter, who now succumbed
to Loki’s usual love of destruction. Killing the unfortunate creature he flung its
lifeless body over his shoulders, thinking it would furnish a good dish when meal
time came.
</p>
<p>Loki then hastened after his companions, and entering Hreidmar’s house with them,
he flung his burden down upon the floor. The moment the dwarf king’s glance fell upon
the seeming otter, he flew into a towering rage, and ere they could offer effective
resistance the gods found themselves lying bound, and they heard Hreidmar declare
that never should they recover their liberty until they could satisfy his thirst for
gold by giving him of that precious substance enough to cover the skin of the otter
inside and out.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“ ‘Now hearken the doom I shall speak! Ye stranger-folk shall be free
</p>
<p class="line">When ye give me the Flame of the Waters, the gathered Gold of the Sea,

</p>
<p class="line">—Lo, this is the doom of the wise, and no doom shall be spoken anew.’ ”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As the otter-skin developed the property of stretching itself to a fabulous size,
no ordinary treasure could suffice to cover it, and the plight of the gods, therefore,
was a very bad one. The case, however, became a little more hopeful when Hreidmar
consented to liberate one of their number. The emissary selected was Loki, who lost
no time in setting off to the waterfall where the dwarf Andvari dwelt, in order that
he might secure the treasure there amassed.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There is a desert of dread in the uttermost part of the world,
</p>
<p class="line">Where over a wall of mountains is a mighty water hurled,
</p>
<p class="line">Whose hidden head none knoweth, nor where it meeteth the sea;
</p>
<p class="line">And that force is the Force of Andvari, and an Elf of the Dark is he.
</p>
<p class="line">In the cloud and the desert he dwelleth amid that land alone;
</p>
<p class="line">And his work is the storing of treasure within his house of stone.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In spite of diligent search, however, Loki could not find the dwarf, until, perceiving
a salmon sporting in the foaming waters, it occurred to him that the dwarf might have
assumed this shape. Borrowing Ran’s net he soon caught the fish, and learned, as he
had suspected, that it was Andvari. Finding that there was nothing else for it, the
dwarf now reluctantly brought forth his mighty treasure and surrendered it all, including
the Helmet of Dread and a hauberk of gold, reserving only a ring which was gifted
with miraculous powers, and which, like a magnet, attracted the precious ore. But
the greedy Loki, catching sight of it, wrenched it from off the dwarf’s finger and
departed laughing, while his victim hurled angry curses after him, declaring that
the ring would ever prove its possessor’s bane and would cause the death of many.

</p>
<p>On arriving at Hreidmar’s house, Loki found the mighty treasure none too great, for
the skin became larger with every object placed upon it, and he was forced to throw
in the ring Andvaranaut (Andvari’s loom), which he had intended to retain, in order
to secure the release of himself and his companions. Andvari’s curse of the gold soon
began to operate. Fafnir and Regin both coveted a share, while Hriedmar gloated over
his treasure night and day, and would not part with an item of it. Fafnir the invincible,
seeing at last that he could not otherwise gratify his lust, slew his father, and
seized the whole of the treasure, then, when Regin came to claim a share he drove
him scornfully away and bade him earn his own living.
</p>
<p>Thus exiled, Regin took refuge among men, to whom he taught the arts of sowing and
reaping. He showed them how to work metals, sail the seas, tame horses, yoke beasts
of burden, build houses, spin, weave, and sew—in short, all the industries of civilised
life, which had hitherto been unknown. Years elapsed, and Regin patiently bided his
time, hoping that some day he would find a hero strong enough to avenge his wrongs
upon Fafnir, whom years of gloating over his treasure had changed into a horrible
dragon, the terror of Gnîtaheid (Glittering Heath), where he had taken up his abode.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>His story finished, Regin turned suddenly to the attentive Sigurd, saying he knew
that the young man could slay the dragon if he wished, and inquiring whether he were
ready to aid him to avenge his wrongs.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

by Regin, who, also, in order to fitly equip the young man for the coming fight, should
forge him a sword, which no blow could break. Twice Regin fashioned a marvellous weapon,
but twice Sigurd broke it to pieces on the anvil. Then Sigurd bethought him of the
broken fragments of Sigmund’s weapon which were treasured by his mother, and going
to Hiordis he begged these from her; and either he or Regin forged from them a blade
so strong that it divided the great anvil in two without being dinted, and whose temper
was such that it neatly severed some wool floating gently upon the stream.

every event in his coming career; after which he took leave of his mother, and accompanied

came a man walking on the waters. Sigurd straightway took him on board his dragon
ship, and the stranger, who gave his name as Feng or Fiöllnir, promised favourable
winds. Also he taught Sigurd how to distinguish auspicious omens. In reality the old
man was Odin or Hnikar, the wave-stiller, but Sigurd did not suspect his identity.

<h3 class="main">The Fight with the Dragon</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sigurd was entirely successful in his descent upon Lygni, whom he slew, together with
many of his followers. He then departed from his reconquered kingdom and returned
with Regin to slay Fafnir. Together they rode through the mountains, which ever rose
higher and higher before them, until they came to a great tract of desert which Regin
said was the haunt of Fafnir. Sigurd now rode on alone until he met a one-eyed stranger,
who bade him dig trenches in the middle of the track along which the dragon daily
dragged his slimy length to the river to quench his thirst, and to lie in wait in
one of these until the monster passed over him, when he could thrust his sword straight
into its heart.
</p>
<p>Sigurd gratefully followed this counsel, and was <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>rewarded with complete success, for as the monster’s loathsome folds rolled overhead,
he thrust his sword upward into its left breast, and as he sprang out of the trench
the dragon lay gasping in the throes of death.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then all sank into silence, and the son of Sigmund stood
</p>
<p class="line">On the torn and furrowed desert by the pool of Fafnir’s blood,
</p>
<p class="line">And the Serpent lay before him, dead, chilly, dull, and grey;
</p>
<p class="line">And over the Glittering Heath fair shone the sun and the day,
</p>
<p class="line">And a light wind followed the sun and breathed o’er the fateful place,
</p>
<p class="line">As fresh as it furrows the sea-plain, or bows the acres’ face.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Regin had prudently remained at a distance until all danger was past, but seeing that
his foe was slain, he now came up. He was fearful lest the young hero should claim
a reward, so he began to accuse him of having murdered his kin, but, with feigned
magnanimity, he declared that instead of requiring life for life, in accordance with
the custom of the North, he would consider it sufficient atonement if Sigurd would
cut out the monster’s heart and roast it for him on a spit.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then Regin spake to Sigurd: ‘Of this slaying wilt thou be free?
</p>
<p class="line">Then gather thou fire together and roast the heart for me,
</p>
<p class="line">That I may eat it and live, and be thy master and more;
</p>
<p class="line">For therein was might and wisdom, and the grudged and hoarded lore:
</p>
<p class="line">—Or, else depart on thy ways afraid from the Glittering Heath.’ ”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Sigurd was aware that a true warrior never refused satisfaction of some kind to the
kindred of the slain, so he agreed to the seemingly small proposal, and immediately
prepared to act as cook, while Regin dozed until the meat was ready. After an interval
Sigurd touched the roast to ascertain whether it were tender, <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>but burning his fingers severely, he instinctively thrust them into his mouth to allay
the smart. No sooner had Fafnir’s blood thus touched his lips than he discovered,
to his utter surprise, that he could understand the songs of the birds, many of which
were already gathering round the carrion. Listening attentively, he found that they
were telling how Regin meditated mischief against him, and how he ought to slay the
old man and take the gold, which was his by right of conquest, after which he ought
to partake of the heart and blood of the dragon. As this coincided with his own wishes,
he slew the evil old man with a thrust of his sword and proceeded to eat and drink
as the birds had suggested, reserving a small portion of Fafnir’s heart for future
consumption. He then wandered off in search of the mighty hoard, and, after donning
the Helmet of Dread, the hauberk of gold, and the ring Andvaranaut, and loading Greyfell
with as much gold as he could carry, he sprang to the saddle and sat listening eagerly
to the birds’ songs to know what his future course should be.

through trackless regions, and the journey was long and cheerless, but at length he
came to the Hindarfiall in Frankland, a tall mountain whose cloud-wreathed summit
seemed circled by fiery flames.

</p>
<p>Sigurd rode up the mountain side, and the light grew more and more vivid as he proceeded,
until when he had neared the summit a barrier of lurid flames stood before him. The
fire burned with a roar which would have daunted the heart of any other, but Sigurd
remembered the words of the birds, and without a moment’s hesitation he plunged bravely
into its very midst.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,

<p class="first">The threatening flames having now died away, Sigurd pursued his journey over a broad
tract of white ashes, directing his course to a great castle, with shield-hung walls.
The great gates stood wide open, and Sigurd rode through them unchallenged by warders
or men at arms. Proceeding cautiously, for he feared some snare, he at last came to
the centre of the courtyard, where he saw a recumbent form cased in armour. Sigurd
dismounted from his steed and eagerly removed the helmet, when he started with surprise
to behold, instead of a warrior, the face of a most beautiful maiden.
</p>
<p>All his efforts to awaken the sleeper were vain, however, until he had removed her
armour, and she lay before him in pure-white linen garments, her long hair falling
in golden waves around her. Then as the last fastening of her armour gave way, she
opened wide her beautiful eyes, which met the rising sun, and first greeting with
rapture the glorious spectacle, she turned to her deliverer, and the young hero and
the maiden loved each other at first sight.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then she turned and gazed on Sigurd, and her eyes met the Volsung’s eyes.

</p>
<p class="line">And she spake unto nothing but him and her lips with the speech-flood moved.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The maiden now proceeded to tell Sigurd her story. Her name was Brunhild, and according
to some authorities she was the daughter of an earthly king <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>whom Odin had raised to the rank of a Valkyr. She had served him faithfully for a
long while, but once had ventured to set her own wishes above his, giving to a younger
and therefore more attractive opponent the victory which Odin had commanded for another.

</p>
<p>In punishment for this act of disobedience, she had been deprived of her office and
banished to earth, where Allfather decreed she should wed like any other member of
her sex. This sentence filled Brunhild’s heart with dismay, for she greatly feared
lest it might be her fate to mate with a coward, whom she would despise. To quiet
these apprehensions, Odin took her to Hindarfiall or Hindfell, and touching her with
the Thorn of Sleep, that she might await in unchanged youth and beauty the coming
of her destined husband, he surrounded her with a barrier of flame which none but
a hero would venture through.
</p>
<p>From the top of Hindarfiall, Brunhild now pointed out to Sigurd her former home, at
Lymdale or Hunaland, telling him he would find her there whenever he chose to come
and claim her as his wife; and then, while they stood on the lonely mountain top together,
Sigurd placed the ring Andvaranaut upon her finger, in token of betrothal, swearing
to love her alone as long as life endured.

father, who, driven away from home, concealed her in a cunningly fashioned harp, until
reaching a distant land he was murdered by a peasant couple for the sake of the gold

on breaking the instrument open, they found a beautiful little girl, whom they deemed

<h3 class="main">The Niblungs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the course of his wanderings, Sigurd came to the land of the Niblungs, the land
of continual mist, where Giuki and Grimhild were king and queen. The latter was specially
to be feared, as she was well versed in magic lore, and could weave spells and concoct
marvellous potions which had power to steep the drinker in temporary forgetfulness
and compel him to yield to her will.
</p>
<p>The king and queen had three sons, Gunnar, Högni, and Guttorm, who were brave young
men, and one daughter, Gudrun, the gentlest as well as the most beautiful of maidens.
All welcomed Sigurd most warmly, and Giuki invited him to tarry awhile. The invitation
was very agreeable after his long wanderings, and Sigurd was glad to stay and share
the pleasures and occupations of the Niblungs. He accompanied them to war, and so
distinguished himself by his valour, that he won the admiration of Grimhild and she
resolved to secure him as her daughter’s husband. One day, therefore, she brewed one
of her magic potions, and when he had partaken of it at the hand of Gudrun, he utterly
forgot Brunhild and his plighted troth, and all his love was diverted unto the queen’s
daughter.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“But the heart was changed in Sigurd; as though it ne’er had been
</p>
<p class="line">His love of Brynhild perished as he gazed on the Niblung Queen:
</p>
<p class="line">Brynhild’s beloved body was e’en as a wasted hearth,
</p>
<p class="line">No more for bale or blessing, for plenty or for dearth.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Although there was not wanting a vague fear that he had forgotten some event in the
past which should rule his conduct, Sigurd asked for and obtained Gudrun’s hand, and
their wedding was celebrated amid the rejoicings of the people, who loved the young
hero very dearly. Sigurd gave his bride some of Fafnir’s heart to eat, and the moment
she had tasted it her nature was changed, and she began to grow cold and silent to
all except him. To further cement his alliance with the two eldest Giukings (as the
sons of Giuki were called) Sigurd entered the “doom ring” with them, and the three
young men cut a sod which was placed upon a shield, beneath which they stood while
they bared and slightly cut their right arms, allowing their blood to mingle in the
fresh earth. Then, when they had sworn eternal friendship, the sod was replaced.
</p>
<p>But although Sigurd loved his wife and felt a true fraternal affection for her brothers,
he could not lose his haunting sense of oppression, and was seldom seen to smile as
radiantly as of old. Giuki had now died, and his eldest son, Gunnar, ruled in his
stead. As the young king was unwedded, Grimhild, his mother, besought him to take
a wife, suggesting that none seemed more worthy to become Queen of the Niblungs than
Brunhild, who, it was reported, sat in a golden hall surrounded by flames, whence
she had declared she would issue only to marry the warrior who would dare brave the
fire for her sake.

success. But when on reaching the summit of the mountain he would have ridden into
the fire, his steed drew back affrighted and he could not induce him to advance a
step. Seeing that his companion’s steed did not show signs of fear, he asked him of
Sigurd; but although Greyfell allowed Gunnar to mount, he would not stir because his

</p>
<p>Now as Sigurd carried the Helmet of Dread, and Grimhild had given Gunnar a magic potion
in case it should be needed, it was possible for the companions to exchange their
forms and features, and seeing that Gunnar could not penetrate the flaming wall Sigurd
proposed to assume the appearance of Gunnar and woo the bride for him. The king was
greatly disappointed, but as no alternative offered he dismounted, and the necessary
exchange was soon effected. Then Sigurd mounted Greyfell in the semblance of his companion,
and this time the steed showed not the least hesitation, but leaped into the flames
at the first touch on his bridle, and soon brought his rider to the castle, where,
in the great hall, sat Brunhild. Neither recognised the other: Sigurd because of the
magic spell cast over him by Grimhild; Brunhild because of the altered appearance
of her lover.
</p>
<p>The maiden shrank in disappointment from the dark-haired intruder, for she had deemed
it impossible for any but Sigurd to ride through the flaming circle. But she advanced
reluctantly to meet her visitor, and when he declared that he had come to woo her,
she <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>permitted him to take a husband’s place at her side, for she was bound by solemn injunction
to accept as her spouse him who should thus seek her through the flames.
</p>
<p>Three days did Sigurd remain with Brunhild, and his bright sword lay bared between
him and his bride. This singular behaviour aroused the curiosity of the maiden, wherefore
Sigurd told her that the gods had bidden him celebrate his wedding thus.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There they went in one bed together; but the foster-brother laid

<p class="line">’Twixt him and the body of Brynhild his bright blue battle-blade;

</div>
<p class="first">When the fourth morning dawned, Sigurd drew the ring Andvaranaut from Brunhild’s hand,
and, replacing it by another, he received her solemn promise that in ten days’ time
she would appear at the Niblung court to take up her duties as queen and faithful
wife.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“ ‘I thank thee, King, for thy goodwill, and thy pledge of love I take,

</div>
<p class="first">The promise given, Sigurd again passed out of the palace, through the ashes, and joined
Gunnar, with whom, after he had reported the success of his venture, he hastened to
exchange forms once more. The warriors then turned their steeds homeward, and only
to Gudrun did Sigurd reveal the secret of her brother’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>wooing, and he gave her the fatal ring, little suspecting the many woes which it was
destined to occasion.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">True to her promise, Brunhild appeared ten days later, and solemnly blessing the house
she was about to enter, she greeted Gunnar kindly, and allowed him to conduct her
to the great hall, where sat Sigurd beside Gudrun. The Volsung looked up at that moment
and as he encountered Brunhild’s reproachful eyes Grimhild’s spell was broken and
the past came back in a flood of bitter recollection. It was too late, however: both
were in honour bound, he to Gudrun and she to Gunnar, whom she passively followed
to the high seat, to sit beside him as the scalds entertained the royal couple with
the ancient lays of their land.
</p>
<p>The days passed, and Brunhild remained apparently indifferent, but her heart was hot
with anger, and often did she steal out of her husband’s palace to the forest, where
she could give vent to her grief in solitude.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gunnar perceived the cold indifference of his wife to his protestations
of affection, and began to have jealous suspicions, wondering whether Sigurd had honestly
told the true story of the wooing, and fearing lest he had taken advantage of his
position to win Brunhild’s love. Sigurd alone continued the even tenor of his way,
striving against none but tyrants and oppressors, and cheering all by his kindly words
and smile.

in the course of which Gudrun accused her sister-in-law of not having kept her faith,
producing the ring Andvaranaut in support of her charge. The sight of the fatal ring
in the hand of her rival crushed Brunhild, and she fled homeward, and lay in speechless
grief day after day, until all thought she must die. In vain did Gunnar and the members
of the royal family seek her in turn and implore her to speak; she would not utter
a word until Sigurd came and inquired the cause of her unutterable grief. Then, like
a long-pent-up stream, her love and anger burst forth, and she overwhelmed the hero
with reproaches, until his heart so swelled with grief for her sorrow that the tight

<p>Words had no power to mend that woeful situation, and Brunhild refused to heed when
Sigurd offered to repudiate Gudrun, saying, as she dismissed him, that she would not
be faithless to Gunnar. The thought that two living men had called her wife was unendurable
to her pride, and the next time her husband sought her presence she implored him to
put Sigurd to death, thus increasing his jealousy and suspicion. He refused to deal
violently with Sigurd, however, because of their oath of good fellowship, and so she
turned to Högni <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>for aid. He, too, did not wish to violate his oath, but he induced Guttorm, by means

too late, that he had not taken measures to avert the dastardly crime.
</p>
<p>The grief of the Niblungs found expression in the public funeral celebration which
was shortly held. A mighty pyre was erected, to which were brought precious hangings,
fresh flowers, and glittering arms, as was the custom for the burial of a prince;
and as these sad preparations took shape, Gudrun was the object of tender solicitude
from the women, who, fearing lest her heart would break, tried to open the flood-gate
of her tears by recounting the bitterest sorrows they had known, one telling of how
she too had lost all she held dear. But these attempts to make her weep were utterly
vain, until at length they laid her husband’s head in her lap, bidding her kiss him
as if he were still alive; then her tears began to flow in torrents.
</p>
<p>The reaction soon set in for Brunhild also; her resentment was all forgotten when
she saw the body of Sigurd laid on the pyre, arrayed as if for battle in burnished
armour, with the Helmet of Dread at his head, and accompanied by his steed, which
was to be burned with him, together with several of his faithful servants who would
not survive his loss. She withdrew to her apartment, and after distributing her possessions
among her handmaidens, she donned her richest array, and stabbed herself as she lay
stretched upon her bed.
</p>
<p>The tidings soon reached Gunnar, who came with all haste to his wife and just in time
to receive her dying injunction to lay her beside the hero she loved, with the glittering,
unsheathed sword between them, as it had lain when he had wooed her by proxy. When
she had breathed her last, these wishes were faithfully <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>executed, and her body was burned with Sigurd’s amid the lamentations of all the Niblungs.

King Hakon. The two women became great friends, and here Gudrun tarried several years,
employing herself in embroidering upon tapestry the great deeds of Sigurd, and watching

<p class="first">In the meantime, Atli, Brunhild’s brother, who was now King of the Huns, had sent
to Gunnar to demand atonement for his sister’s death; and to satisfy his claims Gunnar
had promised that when her years of widowhood had been accomplished he would give
him Gudrun’s hand in marriage. Time passed, and Atli clamoured for the fulfilment
of his promise, wherefore the Niblung brothers, with their mother Grimhild, went to
seek the long-absent princess, and by the aid of the magic potion administered by
Grimhild they succeeded in persuading Gudrun to leave little Swanhild in Denmark and
to become Atli’s wife in the land of the Huns.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gudrun secretly detested her husband, whose avaricious tendencies were
extremely repugnant to her; and even the birth of two sons, Erp and Eitel, did not
console her for the death of her loved ones and the absence of Swanhild. Her thoughts
were continually of the past, and she often spoke of it, little suspecting that her
descriptions of the wealth of the Niblungs had excited Atli’s greed, and that he was
secretly planning some pretext for seizing it.

<p>Atli at last decided to send Knefrud or Wingi, one of his servants, to invite the
Niblung princes to visit his court, intending to slay them when he should have them
in his power; but Gudrun, fathoming this design, sent a rune message to her brothers,
together with the ring Andvaranaut, around which she had twined a wolf’s hair. On
the way, however, the messenger partly effaced the runes, thus changing their meaning;
and when he appeared before the Niblungs, Gunnar <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>accepted the invitation, in spite of Högni’s and Grimhild’s warnings, and an ominous

and arrived at Atli’s hall, where, finding that they had been foully entrapped, they
slew the traitor Knefrud, and prepared to sell their lives as dearly as possible.
</p>
<p>Gudrun hastened to meet them with tender embraces, and, seeing that they must fight,
she grasped a weapon and loyally aided them in the terrible massacre which ensued.
After the first onslaught, Gunnar kept up the spirits of his followers by playing
on his harp, which he laid aside only when the assaults were renewed. Thrice the brave
Niblungs resisted the assault of the Huns, until all save Gunnar and Högni <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>had perished, and the king and his brother, wounded, faint, and weary, fell into the

<p>Atli had prudently abstained from taking any active part in the fight, and he now
had his brothers-in-law brought in turn before him, promising them freedom if they
would reveal the hiding-place of the golden hoard; but they proudly kept silence,
and it was only after much torture that Gunnar spake, saying that he had sworn a solemn
oath never to reveal the secret as long as Högni lived. At the same time he declared
that he would believe his brother dead only when his heart was brought to him on a

his servants, fearing to lay hands on such a grim warrior, slew the cowardly scullion
Hialli. The trembling heart of this poor wretch called forth contemptuous words from
Gunnar, who declared that such a timorous organ could never have belonged to his fearless
brother. Atli again issued angry commands, and this time the unquivering heart of
Högni was produced, whereupon Gunnar, turning to the monarch, solemnly swore that
since the secret now rested with him alone it would never be revealed.

a den of venomous snakes; but this did not daunt the reckless Niblung, and, his harp
having been flung after him in derision, he calmly sat in the pit, harping with his
toes, and lulling to sleep all the reptiles save one only. It was said that Atli’s
mother had taken the form of this snake, and that she it was who now bit him in the
side, and silenced his triumphant song for ever.
</p>
<p>To celebrate his triumph, Atli now ordered a great feast, commanding Gudrun to be
present to wait upon him. At this banquet he ate and drank heartily, little suspecting
that his wife had slain both his sons, and had served up their roasted hearts and
their blood mixed with wine in cups made of their skulls. After a time the king and
his guests became intoxicated, when Gudrun, according to one version of the story,
set fire to the palace, and as the drunken men were aroused, too late to escape, she
revealed what she had done, and first stabbing her husband, she calmly perished in
the flames with the Huns. Another <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>version relates, however, that she murdered Atli with Sigurd’s sword, and having placed
his body on a ship, which she sent adrift, she cast herself into the sea and was drowned.

traitor, and as part of a plan to compass the death of the royal family that he might
claim the kingdom, he accused Randwer of having tried to win his young stepmother’s
affections. This accusation so roused the anger of Ermenrich that he ordered his son
to be hanged, and Swanhild to be trampled to death under the feet of wild horses.
The beauty of this daughter of Sigurd and Gudrun was such, however, that even the
wild steeds could not be induced to harm her until she had been hidden from their
sight <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>under a great blanket, when they trod her to death under their cruel hoofs.
</p>
<p>Upon learning the fate of her beloved daughter, Gudrun called her three sons to her
side, and girding them with armour and weapons against which nothing but stone could
prevail, she bade them depart and avenge their murdered sister, after which she died
of grief, and was burned on a great pyre.
</p>
<p>The three youths, Sörli, Hamdir, and Erp, proceeded to Ermenrich’s kingdom, but ere
they met their foes, the two eldest, deeming Erp too young to assist them, taunted
him with his small size, and finally slew him. Sörli and Hamdir then attacked Ermenrich,
cut off his hands and feet, and would have slain him but for a one-eyed stranger who
suddenly appeared and bade the bystanders throw stones at the young men. His orders
were immediately carried out, and Sörli and Hamdir soon fell slain under the shower

their foes, the demons of cold and darkness. Sigurd, like Balder, is beloved of all;
he marries Brunhild, the dawn maiden, whom he finds in the midst of flames, the flush
of morn, and parts from her only to find her again when his career is ended. His body
is burned on the funeral pyre, which, like Balder’s, represents either the setting
sun or the last gleam of summer, of which he too is a type. The slaying of Fafnir
symbolises the destruction of the demon of cold or darkness, who has stolen the golden
hoard of summer or the yellow rays of the sun.
</p>
<p>According to other authorities, this Saga is based upon history. Atli is the cruel
Attila, the “Scourge of God,” while Gunnar is Gundicarius, a Burgundian monarch, whose
kingdom was destroyed by the Huns, and who was slain with his brothers in 451. Gudrun
is the Burgundian princess Ildico, who slew her husband on her wedding-night, as has
already been related, using the glittering blade which had once belonged to the sun-god
to avenge her murdered kinsmen.

<h3 class="main">Bishop Tegnér</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Probably no writer of the nineteenth century did so much to awaken interest in the
literary treasures of Scandinavia as Bishop Esaias Tegnér, whom a Swedish author characterised
as, “that mighty Genie who organises even disorder.”
</p>
<p>Tegnér’s “Frithiof Saga” has been translated once at least into every European tongue,
and some twenty times into English and German. Goethe spoke of the work with the greatest
enthusiasm, and the tale, which gives a matchless picture of the life of our heathen
ancestors in the North, drew similar praise from Longfellow, who considered it to
be one of the most remarkable productions of his century.
</p>
<p>Although Tegnér has chosen for his theme the Frithiof saga only, we find that that
tale is the sequel to the older but less interesting Thorsten saga, of which we give
here a very brief outline, merely to enable the reader to understand clearly every
allusion in the more modern poem.
</p>
<p>As is so frequently the case with these ancient tales, the story begins with Haloge
(Loki), who came north with Odin, and began to reign over northern Norway, which from
him was called Halogaland. According to Northern mythology, this god had two lovely
daughters. They were carried off by bold suitors, who, banished from the mainland
by Haloge’s curses and magic spells, took refuge with their newly won wives upon neighbouring
islands.
</p>

<h3 class="main">Birth of Viking</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus it happened that Haloge’s grandson, Viking, <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>was born upon the island of Bornholm, in the Baltic Sea, where he dwelt until he was
fifteen, and where he became the biggest and strongest man of his time. Rumours of
his valour finally reached Hunvor, a Swedish princess, who was oppressed by the attentions
of a gigantic suitor whom none dared drive away, and she sent for Viking to deliver
her.
</p>
<p>Thus summoned, the youth departed, after having received from his father a magic sword
named Angurvadel, whose blows would prove fatal even to a giant like the suitor of
Hunvor. A “holmgang,” as a duel was termed in the North, ensued as soon as the hero
arrived upon the scene, and Viking, having slain his antagonist, could have married
the princess had it not been considered disgraceful for a Northman to marry before
he was twenty.
</p>
<p>To beguile the time of waiting for his promised bride, Viking set out in a well-manned
dragon ship; and cruising about the Northern and Southern seas, he met with countless
adventures. During this time he was particularly persecuted by the kindred of the
giant he had slain, who were adepts in magic, and they brought upon him innumerable
perils by land and sea.
</p>
<p>Aided and abetted by his bosom friend, Halfdan, Viking escaped every danger, slew
many of his foes, and, after rescuing Hunvor, whom, in the meantime, the enemy had
carried off to India, he settled down in Sweden. His friend, faithful in peace as
well as in war, settled near him, and married also, choosing for wife Ingeborg, Hunvor’s
attendant.
</p>
<p>The saga now describes the long, peaceful winters, when the warriors feasted and listened
to the tales of scalds, rousing themselves to energetic efforts only when returning
spring again permitted them to launch <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>their dragon ships and set out once more upon their piratical expeditions.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">“Then the Scald took his harp and sang,

</div>
</div>
<p class="first xd32e1120"><i>Longfellow’s Saga of King Olaf.</i>
</p>
<p>In the old story the scalds relate with great gusto every phase of attack and defence
during cruise and raid, and describe every blow given and received, dwelling with
satisfaction upon the carnage and lurid flames which envelop both enemies and ships
in common ruin. A fierce fight is often an earnest of future friendship, however,
and we are told that Halfdan and Viking, having failed to conquer Njorfe, a foeman
of mettle, sheathed their swords after a most obstinate struggle, and accepted their
enemy as a third link in their close bond of friendship.
</p>
<p>On returning home from one of these customary raids, Viking lost his beloved wife;
and, entrusting her child, Ring, to the care of a foster father, after undergoing
a short period of mourning, the brave warrior married again. This time his marital
bliss was more lasting, for the saga tells that his second wife bore him nine stalwart
sons.
</p>
<p>Njorfe, King of Uplands, in Norway, also rejoiced in a family of nine brave sons.
Now, although their <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>fathers were united in bonds of the closest friendship, having sworn blood brotherhood
according to the true Northern rites, the young men were jealous of one another, and
greatly inclined to quarrel.

<h3 class="main">The Game of Ball</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Notwithstanding this smouldering animosity, the youths often met; and the saga relates
that they used to play ball together, and gives a description of the earliest ball
game on record in the Northern annals. Viking’s sons, as tall and strong as he, were
inclined to be rather reckless of their opponents’ welfare, and, judging from the
following account, translated from the old saga, the players were often left in as
sorry a condition as after a modern game.
</p>
<p>“The next morning the brothers went to the games, and generally had the ball during
the day; they pushed men and let them fall roughly, and beat others. At night three
men had their arms broken, and many were bruised or maimed.”
</p>
<p>The game between Njorfe’s and Viking’s sons culminated in a disagreement, and one
of Njorfe’s sons struck one of his opponents a dangerous and treacherous blow. Prevented
from taking his revenge then and there by the interference of the spectators, the
injured man made a trivial excuse to return to the ground alone; and, meeting his
assailant there, he slew him.
</p>

<h3 class="main">The Blood Feud</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Viking heard that one of his sons had slain one of his friend’s children, he
was very indignant, and mindful of his oath to avenge all Njorfe’s wrongs, he banished
the young murderer. The other brothers, on hearing this sentence, vowed that they
would accompany the exile, and so Viking sorrowfully bade them farewell, <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>giving his sword Angurvadel to Thorsten, the eldest, and cautioning him to remain
quietly on an island in Lake Wener until all danger of retaliation on the part of
Njorfe’s remaining sons should be over.
</p>
<p>The young men obeyed; but Njorfe’s sons were determined to avenge their brother, and
although they had no boats to convey them over the lake, they made use of a conjurer’s
art to bring about a great frost. Accompanied by many armed men, they then stole noiselessly
over the ice to attack Thorsten and his brothers, and a terrible carnage ensued. Only
two of the attacking party managed to escape, but they left, as they fancied, all
their foes among the dead.
</p>
<p>Then came Viking to bury his sons, and he found that two of them, Thorsten and Thorer,
were still alive; whereupon he secretly conveyed them to a cellar beneath his dwelling,
and in due time they recovered from their wounds.
</p>
<p>Njorfe’s two surviving sons soon discovered by magic arts that their opponents were
not dead, and they made a second desperate but vain attempt to kill them. Viking saw
that the quarrel would be incessantly renewed if his sons remained at home; so he
now sent them to Halfdan, whose court they reached after a series of adventures which
in many points resemble those of Theseus on his way to Athens.
</p>
<p>When spring came round Thorsten embarked on a piratical excursion, in the course of
which he encountered Jokul, Njorfe’s eldest son, who, meanwhile, had taken forcible
possession of the kingdom of Sogn, having killed the king, banished his heir, Belé,
and changed his beautiful daughter, Ingeborg, into the similitude of an old witch.
</p>
<p>Throughout the story Jokul is represented as somewhat of a coward, for he resorted
by preference to <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>magic when he wished to injure Viking’s sons. Thus he stirred up great tempests, and
Thorsten, after twice suffering shipwreck, was only saved from the waves by the seeming
witch, whom he promised to marry in gratitude for her good offices. Thorsten, advised
by Ingeborg, now went in search of Belé, whom he found and replaced upon his hereditary
throne, having sworn eternal friendship with him. After this, the baleful spell was
removed, and Ingeborg, now revealed in her native beauty, was united to Thorsten,
and dwelt with him at Framnäs.

treatment, and which had been stolen from him.

were given as a <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>kingdom to the latter, he voluntarily pledging himself to pay a yearly tribute to
Belé. Next Thorsten and Belé went in quest of a magic ring, or armlet, once forged
by Völund, the smith, and stolen by Soté, a famous pirate.

<p>This bold robber was so afraid lest some one should gain possession of the magic ring,
that he had buried himself alive with it in a mound in Bretland. Here his ghost was
said to keep constant watch over it, and when Thorsten entered his tomb, Belé, who
waited outside, heard the sound of frightful blows given and returned, and saw lurid
gleams of supernatural fire.
</p>
<p>When Thorsten finally staggered out of the mound, pale and bloody, but triumphant,
he refused to speak of the horrors he had encountered to win the coveted treasure,
but often would he say, as he showed it, “I trembled but once in my life, and ’twas

Helgé, were born to Belé. The lads played together, and were already well grown when
Ingeborg, Belé’s little daughter, was born, and some time later the child was entrusted
to the care of Hilding, who was already Frithiof’s foster father, as Thorsten’s frequent
absences made it difficult for him to undertake the training of his boy.

of Balder, where the king, feeling that his end was near, had convened a solemn assembly,

to the people as his chosen successors. The young heirs were very coldly received
on this occasion, for Helgé was of a sombre and taciturn disposition, and inclined
to the life of a priest, and Halfdan was of a weak, effeminate nature, and noted for

<p>Hilding did not understand such mode of answering, and at length rebuked Frithiof
for his indifference. Then Frithiof rose, and pressing kindly the old man’s hand,
he bade him tell the kings that he was too deeply offended to listen to their appeal.
</p>
<p>Helgé and Halfdan, thus forced to fight without their bravest leader, preferred to
make a treaty with Sigurd Ring, and they agreed to give him not only their sister
Ingeborg, but also a yearly tribute.

<p class="first">While they were thus engaged at Sogn Sound, Frithiof hastened to Balder’s temple,
to which Ingeborg had been sent for security, and where, as Hilding had declared,
he found her a prey to grief. Now although it was considered a sacrilege for man and
woman to exchange a word in the sacred building, Frithiof could not forbear to console
her; and, forgetting all else, he spoke to her and comforted her, quieting all her
apprehensions of the gods’ anger by assuring her that Balder, the good, must view
their innocent passion with approving eyes, for love so pure as theirs could defile
no sanctuary; and they ended by plighting their troth before the shrine of Balder.

</p>
<p>Reassured by this reasoning, which received added strength from the voice which spoke
loudly from her own heart, Ingeborg could not refuse to see and converse with Frithiof.
During the kings’ absence the young lovers met every day, and they exchanged love-tokens,
Frithiof giving to Ingeborg Völund’s arm-ring, which she solemnly promised to send
back to her lover should she be compelled to break her promise to live for him alone.
Frithiof lingered at Framnäs until the kings’ return, when, yielding to the fond entreaties
of Ingeborg the Fair, he again appeared before them, and pledged himself to free them

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But although this offer was received with acclamation by the assembled warriors, Helgé
scornfully demanded of Frithiof whether he had spoken with Ingeborg and so defiled
the temple of Balder.
</p>
<p>A shout of “Say nay, Frithiof! say nay!” broke <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>from the ring of warriors, but he proudly answered: “I would not lie to gain Valhalla.
I have spoken to thy sister, Helgé, yet have I not broken Balder’s peace.”

</p>
<p>A murmur of horror passed through the ranks at this avowal, and when the harsh voice
of Helgé was raised in judgment, none was there to gainsay the justice of the sentence.
</p>
<p>This apparently was not a harsh one, but Helgé well knew that it meant death, and
he so intended it.
</p>
<p>Far westward lay the Orkney Islands, ruled by Jarl Angantyr, whose yearly tribute
to Belé was withheld now that the old king lay in his cairn. Hard-fisted he was said
to be, and heavy of hand, and to Frithiof was given the task of demanding the tribute
face to face.
</p>
<p>Before he sailed upon the judgment-quest, however, he once more sought Ingeborg, and
implored her to elope with him to a home in the sunny South, where her happiness should
be his law, and where she should rule over his subjects as his honoured wife. But
Ingeborg sorrowfully refused to accompany him, saying that, since her father was no
more, she was in duty bound to obey her brothers implicitly, and could not marry without
their consent.
</p>
<p>The fiery spirit of Frithiof was at first impatient under this disappointment of his
hopes, but in the end his noble nature conquered, and after a heartrending parting
scene, he embarked upon Ellida, and sorrowfully sailed out of the harbour, while Ingeborg,
through a mist of tears, watched the sail as it faded and disappeared in the distance.
</p>
<p>The vessel was barely out of sight when Helgé sent for two witches named Heid and
Ham, bidding them by incantations to stir up a tempest at sea in which it would be
impossible for even the god-given vessel Ellida to live, that so all on board should
perish. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>witches immediately complied; and with Helgé’s aid they soon stirred up a storm the
fury of which is unparalleled in history.

<p>The Tempest
</p>
<p>Unfrighted by tossing waves and whistling blasts, Frithiof sang a cheery song to reassure
his terrified crew; but when the peril grew so great that his exhausted followers
gave themselves up for lost, he bethought him of tribute to the goddess Ran, who ever
requires gold of them who would rest in peace under the ocean wave. Taking his armlet,
he hewed it with his sword and made fair division among his men.

<p>He then bade Björn hold the rudder, and himself climbed to the mast-top to view the
horizon. While perched there he descried a whale, upon which the two witches were
riding the storm. Speaking to his good ship, which was gifted with power of understanding
and could obey his commands, he now ran down both whale and witches, and the sea was
reddened with their blood. At the same instant the wind fell, the waves ceased to
threaten, and fair weather soon smiled again upon the seas.
</p>
<p>Exhausted by their previous superhuman efforts and by the labour of baling their water-logged
vessel, the men were too weak to land when they at last reached the Orkney Islands,
and had to be carried ashore by Björn and Frithiof, who gently laid them down on the
sand, bidding them rest and refresh themselves after all the hardships they had endured.

<p>The arrival of Frithiof and his men, and their mode of landing, had been noted by
the watchman of Angantyr, who immediately informed his master of all <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>he had seen. The jarl exclaimed that the ship which had weathered such a gale could
be none but Ellida, and that its captain was doubtless Frithiof, Thorsten’s gallant
son. At these words one of his Berserkers, Atlé, caught up his weapons and strode
from the hall, vowing that he would challenge Frithiof, and thus satisfy himself concerning
the veracity of the tales he had heard of the young hero’s courage.

in the North, and well matched were the heroes, but in the end Frithiof threw his
antagonist, whom he would have slain then and there had his sword been within reach.
Atlé saw his intention, and bade him go in search of the weapon, promising to remain
motionless during his absence. Frithiof, knowing that such a warrior’s promise was
inviolable, immediately obeyed; but when he returned with his sword, and found his
antagonist calmly awaiting death, he relented, and bade Atlé rise and live.

<p>Together the appeased warriors now wended their way to Angantyr’s hall, which Frithiof
found to be far different from the rude dwellings of his native land. The walls were
covered with leather richly decorated with gilt designs. The chimney-piece was of
marble, and glass panes were in the window-frames. A soft light was diffused from
many candles burning in silver branches, and the tables groaned under the most luxurious
fare.

<p>High in a silver chair sat the jarl, clad in a coat of golden mail, over which was

old friend Thorsten,” said he, “and his brave son is equally welcome at my board.”
</p>
<p>Nothing loth, Frithiof seated himself beside his host, and after he had eaten and
drunk he recounted his adventures upon land and sea.
</p>
<p>At last, however, Frithiof made known his errand, whereupon Angantyr said that he
owed no tribute to Helgé, and would pay him none; but that he would give the required
sum as a free gift to his old friend’s son, leaving him at liberty to dispose of it
as he pleased. Meantime, since the season was unpropitious for the return journey,
and storms continually swept the sea, the king invited Frithiof to tarry with him
over the winter; and it was only when the gentle spring breezes were blowing once
more that he at last allowed him to depart.

the hero, after six days, came in sight of Framnäs, and found that his home had been
reduced to a shapeless heap of ashes by Helgé’s orders. Sadly Frithiof strode over
the ravaged site of his childhood’s home, and as he viewed the desolate scene his
heart burned within him. The ruins were not entirely deserted, however, and suddenly
Frithiof felt the cold nozzle of his hound thrust into his hand. A few moments later
his favourite steed bounded to his master’s side, and the faithful creatures were
well-nigh frantic with delight. Then came Hilding to greet him with the information
that Ingeborg was now the wife of Sigurd Ring. When Frithiof heard this he flew into
a Berserker rage, and bade his men scuttle the vessels in the harbour, while he strode
to the temple in search of Helgé.
</p>
<p>The king stood crowned amid a circle of priests, some of whom brandished flaming pine-knots,
while all grasped a sacrificial flint knife. Suddenly there was a clatter of arms
and in burst Frithiof, his brow dark as autumn storms. Helgé’s face went pale as he
confronted the angry hero, for he knew what his coming presaged. “Take thy tribute,
King,” said Frithiof, and with the words, he took the purse from his girdle and flung
it in Helgé’s face with such force that blood gushed from his mouth and he fell swooning
at Balder’s feet.
</p>
<p>The silver-bearded priests advanced to the scene of violence, but Frithiof motioned
them back, and his looks were so threatening that they durst not disobey.
</p>
<p>Then his eye fell upon the arm-ring which he had given to Ingeborg and which Helgé
had placed upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>the arm of Balder, and striding up to the wooden image he said: “Pardon, great Balder,
not for thee was the ring wrested from Völund’s tomb!” Then he seized the ring, but
strongly as he tugged it would not come apart. At last he put forth all his strength,
and with a sudden jerk he recovered the ring, and at the same time the image of the
god fell prone across the altar fire. The next moment it was enveloped in flames,
and before aught could be done the whole temple was wreathed in fire and smoke.

way when they began to sink, and Björn said with a laugh, “What Ran enfolds I trust
she will keep.” Even King Helgé was with difficulty got ashore, and the survivors
were forced to stand in helpless inactivity while Ellida’s great sails slowly sank
beneath the horizon. It was thus that Frithiof sadly saw his native land vanish from
sight; and as it disappeared he breathed a tender farewell to the beloved country
which he never expected to see again.
</p>
<p>After thus parting from his native land, Frithiof roved the sea as a pirate, or viking.
His code was never to settle anywhere, to sleep on his shield, to fight and neither
give nor take quarter, to protect the ships which paid him tribute and to plunder
the others, and to distribute all the booty to his men, reserving for himself nothing
but the glory of the enterprise. Sailing and fighting thus, Frithiof visited many
lands, and came at last to the sunny isles of Greece, whither he would fain have carried
Ingeborg as his bride; and the sights called up such a flood of sad memories that

set out on foot alone for the court of Sigurd Ring, arriving there as the Yuletide

<p>Terrified by this exhibition of superhuman strength, the courtiers quickly withdrew
from the dangerous vicinity, while Sigurd Ring, whose attention was attracted by the
commotion, sternly bade the stranger-guest approach and tell who thus dared to break
the peace in his royal hall.
</p>
<p>Frithiof answered evasively that he was fostered in penitence, that he inherited want,
and that he came from the wolf; as to his name, this did not matter. The king, as
was the courteous custom, did not press him further, but invited him to take a seat
beside him and the queen, and to share his good cheer. “But first,” said he, “let
fall the clumsy covering which veils, if I mistake not, a proper form.”
</p>
<p>Frithiof gladly accepted the invitation thus cordially <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>given, and when the hairy hide fell from off his head and shoulders, he stood disclosed
in the pride of youth, much to the surprise of the assembled warriors.
</p>
<p>But although his appearance marked him as of no common race, none of the courtiers
recognised him. It was different, however, with Ingeborg. Had any curious eye been
upon her at that moment her changing colour and the quick heaving of her breast would
have revealed her deep emotion.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The astonish’d queen’s pale cheeks, how fast-changing rose-tints dye!—

</p>
<p>Frithiof had barely taken his seat at the board when with flourish of trumpets a great
boar was brought in and placed before the king. In accordance with the Yule-tide custom
of those days the old monarch rose, and touching the head of the animal, he uttered
a vow that with the help of Frey, Odin, and Thor, he would conquer the bold champion
Frithiof. The next moment Frithiof, too, was upon his feet, and dashing his sword
upon the great wooden bench he declared that Frithiof was his kinsman and he also
would vow that though all the world withstood, no harm should reach the hero while
he had power to wield his sword.
</p>
<p>At this unexpected interruption the warriors had risen quickly from the oaken benches,
but Sigurd Ring smiled indulgently at the young man’s vehemence and said: “Friend,
thy words are overbold, but never yet was guest restrained from uttering his thoughts
in this kingly hall.” Then he turned to Ingeborg and bade her fill to the brim with
her choicest mead a huge horn, richly decorated, which stood in front of her, and
present <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>it to the guest. The queen obeyed with downcast eyes, and the trembling of her hand
caused the liquid to overflow. Two ordinary men could hardly have drained the mighty
draught, but Frithiof raised it to his lips, and when he removed the horn not one
drop of the mead remained.
</p>
<p>Ere the banquet was ended Sigurd Ring invited the youthful stranger to remain at his
court until the return of spring, and accepting the proffered hospitality, Frithiof
became the constant companion of the royal couple, whom he accompanied upon all occasions.
</p>
<p>One day Sigurd Ring set out to a banquet with Ingeborg. They travelled in a sleigh,
while Frithiof, with steel-shod feet, sped gracefully by their side, cutting many
mystic characters in the ice. Their way lay over a dangerous portion of the frozen
surface, and Frithiof warned the king that it would be prudent to avoid this. He would
not listen to the counsel, however, and suddenly the sleigh sank in a deep fissure,
which threatened to engulph it with the king and queen. But like falcon descending
upon its quarry, Frithiof was at their side in a moment, and without apparent effort
he dragged the steed and its burden on to the firm ice. “In good sooth,” said Ring,
“Frithiof himself could not have done better.”
</p>
<p>The long winter came to an end, and in the early spring the king and queen arranged
a hunting-party in which all the court were to take part. During the progress of the
chase the advancing years of Sigurd Ring made it impossible for him to keep up with
the eager hunt, and thus it happened that he dropped behind, until at length he was
left with Frithiof as his sole companion. They rode slowly together until they reached
a pleasant dell which invited the weary king to <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>repose, and he declared that he would lie down for a season to rest.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then threw Frithiof down his mantle, and upon the greensward spread,
</p>
<p class="line">And the ancient king so trustful laid on Frithiof’s knee his head;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the aged king was thus reposing, a bird sang to Frithiof from a tree near by,
bidding him take advantage of his host’s powerlessness to slay him, and recover the
bride of whom he had been unfairly deprived. But although Frithiof’s hot young heart
clamoured for his beloved, he utterly refused to entertain the dastardly suggestion,
but, fearing lest he should be overcome by temptation, despite his horror at the thought,
he impulsively flung his sword far from him into a neighbouring thicket.
</p>
<p>A few moments later Sigurd Ring opened his eyes, and informed Frithiof that he had
only feigned sleep; he told him also that having recognised him from the first, he
had tested him in many ways, and had found his honour equal to his courage. Old age
had now overtaken him and he felt that death was drawing nigh. In but a short time,
therefore, Frithiof might hope to realise his dearest hope, and Sigurd Ring told him
that he would die happy if he would stay by him until the end.
</p>
<p>A revulsion of feeling had, however, overtaken Frithiof, and he told the aged king
that he felt that Ingeborg could never be his, because of the wrath of Balder. Too
long had he stayed; he would now go once more upon the sea and would seek death in
the fray, that so he might appease the offended gods.
</p>
<p>Full of his resolve, he quickly made preparations to <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>depart, but when he returned to the court to bid farewell to his royal hosts he found
that Sigurd Ring was at the point of death. The old warrior bethought him that “a
straw death” would not win the favour of Odin, and in the presence of Frithiof and
his court he slashed bravely the death runes on his arm and breast. Then clasping
Ingeborg with one hand, he raised the other in blessing over Frithiof and his youthful
son, and so passed in peace to the halls of the blessed.

<p class="first">The warriors of the nation now assembled in solemn Thing to choose a successor to
the throne. Frithiof had won the people’s enthusiastic admiration, and they would
fain have elected him king; but he raised Sigurd Ring’s little son high on his shield
when he heard the shout which acclaimed his name, and presented the boy to the assembly
as their future king, publicly swearing to uphold him until he was of age to defend
the realm. The lad, weary of his cramped position, boldly sprang to the ground as
soon as Frithiof’s speech was ended, and alighted upon his feet. This act of agile
daring in one so young appealed to the rude Northmen, and a loud shout arose, “We
choose thee, shield-borne child!”

<p>According to some accounts, Frithiof now made war against Ingeborg’s brothers, and
after conquering them, allowed them to retain their kingdom on condition that they
paid him a yearly tribute. Then he and Ingeborg remained in Ringric until the young
king was able to assume the government, when they repaired to Hordaland, a kingdom
Frithiof had obtained by conquest, and which he left to his sons Gungthiof and Hunthiof.
</p>
<p>Bishop Tegnér’s conclusion, however, differs very considerably, and if it appears
less true to the rude temper of the rugged days of the sea-rovers, its superior spiritual
qualities make it more attractive. According to Tegnér’s poem, Frithiof was urged
by the people of Sigurd Ring to espouse Ingeborg and remain amongst them as guardian
of the realm. But he answered that this might not be, since the wrath of Balder still
burned against him, and none else could bestow his cherished bride. He told the people
that he would fare over the seas and seek forgiveness of the god, and soon after,
his farewells were spoken, and once more his vessel was speeding before the wind.
</p>
<p>Frithiof’s first visit was paid to his father’s burial mound, where, plunged in melancholy
at the desolation around, he poured out his soul to the outraged god. He reminded
him that it was the custom of the Northmen to exact blood-fines for kinsmen slain,
and surely the blessed gods would not be less forgiving than the earth-born. Passionately
he adjured Balder to show him how he could make reparation for his <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>unpremeditated fault, and suddenly, an answer was vouchsafed, and Frithiof beheld
in the clouds a vision of a new temple.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Then sudden, o’er the western waters pendent,
</p>
<p class="line">An Image comes, with gold and flames resplendent,

<p>The hero immediately understood that the gods had thus indicated a means of atonement,

exceeded the splendour of the old shrine, rose out of the ruins.

<p>Meantime, while the timbers were being hewed, King Helgé was absent upon a foray amongst
the Finnish mountains. One day it chanced that his band passed by a crag where stood
the lonely shrine of some forgotten god, and King Helgé scaled the rocky summit with
intent to raze the ruined walls. The lock held fast, and, as Helgé tugged fiercely
at the mouldered gate, suddenly a sculptured image of the deity, rudely summoned from
his ancient sleep, started from his niche above.
</p>
<p>Heavily he fell upon the head of the intruder, and Helgé stretched his length upon
the rocky floor, nor stirred again.
</p>
<p>When the temple was duly consecrated to Balder’s service, Frithiof stood by the altar
to await the coming of his expected bride. But Halfdan first crossed the threshold,
his faltering gait showing plainly that he feared an unfriendly reception. Seeing
this, Frithiof unbuckled his sword and strode frankly to Halfdan with hand outstretched,
whereupon the king, blushing deeply, grasped heartily the proffered hand, and from
that moment all their differences were forgotten. The next moment Ingeborg approached
and the renewed amity of the long-sundered friends was ratified with the hand of the
bride, which Halfdan placed in that of his new brother.

<h3 class="main">The Decline of the Gods</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the distinctive features of Northern mythology is that the people always believed
that their gods belonged to a finite race. The Æsir had had a beginning; therefore,
it was reasoned, they must have an end; and as they were born from a mixture of the
divine and giant elements, being thus imperfect, they bore within them the germ of
death, and were, like men, doomed to suffer physical death in order to attain spiritual
immortality.
</p>
<p>The whole scheme of Northern mythology was therefore a drama, every step leading gradually
to the climax or tragic end, when, with true poetic justice, punishment and reward
were impartially meted out. In the foregoing chapters, the gradual rise and decline
of the gods have been carefully traced. We have recounted how the Æsir tolerated the
presence of evil, personated by Loki, in their midst; how they weakly followed his
advice, allowed him to involve them in all manner of difficulties from which they
could be extricated only at the price of part of their virtue or peace, and finally
permitted him to gain such ascendency over them that he did not scruple to rob them
of their dearest possession, purity, or innocence, as personified by Balder the good.
</p>
<p>Too late the gods realised how evil was this spirit that had found a home among them,
and too late they banished Loki to earth, where men, following the gods’ example,
listened to his teachings, and were corrupted by his sinister influence.

and devour them; and as their smiles disappeared the earth grew sad and cold, and

their golden couches and sallied bravely out of the great hall, armed for the coming
fray, and, mounting their impatient steeds, they galloped over the quivering rainbow
bridge to the spacious field of Vigrid, where, as Vafthrudnir had predicted long before,
the last battle was to take place.

hated.

<p>All the pent-up antagonism of ages was now let loose in a torrent of hate, each member
of the opposing hosts fighting with grim determination, as did our ancestors of old,
hand to hand and face to face. With a mighty shock, heard above the roar of battle
which filled the universe, Odin and the Fenris wolf came into impetuous contact, while
Thor attacked the Midgard snake, and Tyr came to grips with the dog Garm. Frey closed
with Surtr, Heimdall with Loki, whom he had defeated once before, and the remainder
of the gods and all the Einheriar engaged foes equally worthy of their courage. But,
in spite of their daily preparation in the heavenly city, Valhalla’s host was doomed
to succumb, and Odin was amongst the first of the shining ones to be slain. Not even
the high courage and mighty attributes of Allfather could withstand the tide of evil
as personified in the Fenris wolf. At each succeeding moment of the struggle its colossal
size assumed greater proportions, until finally its wide-open jaws embraced all the
space between heaven and earth, and the foul monster rushed furiously upon the father
of gods and engulphed him bodily within its horrid maw.

<p>None of the gods could lend Allfather a helping hand at that critical moment, for
it was a time of sore trial to all. Frey put forth heroic efforts, but Surtr’s flashing
sword now dealt him a death-stroke. In his struggle with the arch-enemy, Loki, Heimdall
fared better, but his final conquest was dearly bought, for he, too, fell dead. The
struggle between Tyr and Garm <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>had the same tragic end, and Thor, after a most terrible encounter with the Midgard

day was not imperfect, as the first sun had been, and its rays were no longer so ardent
that a shield had to be placed between it and the earth. These more beneficent rays
soon caused the earth to renew its green mantle, and to bring forth flowers and fruit

of the Odinic faith has come down to us in the Eddas and Sagas, were not definitely
converted until the eleventh century,—although they had come in contact with Christians
during their viking raids nearly six centuries before,—it is very probable that the
Northern scalds gleaned <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>some idea of the Christian doctrines, and that this knowledge influenced them to a
certain extent, and coloured their descriptions of the end of the world and the regeneration
of the earth. It was perhaps this vague knowledge, also, which induced them to add
to the Edda a verse, which is generally supposed to have been an interpolation, proclaiming
that another God, too mighty to name, would arise to bear rule over Gimli. From his
heavenly seat he would judge mankind, and separate the bad from the good. The former
would be banished to the horrors of Nastrond, while the good would be transported

<p>There were two other heavenly mansions, however, one reserved for the dwarfs and the
other for the giants; for as these creatures had no free will, and but blindly executed
the decrees of fate, they were not thought to be responsible for any harm done by
them, and were therefore held to be undeserving of punishment.
</p>
<p>The dwarfs, ruled by Sindri, were said to occupy a hall in the Nida mountains, where
they drank the sparkling mead, while the giants took their pleasure in the hall Brimer,
situated in the region Okolnur (not cool), for the power of cold was entirely annihilated,

<h3 class="main">Comparative Mythology</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the past fifty years learned men of many nations have investigated philology
and comparative mythology so thoroughly that they have ascertained beyond the possibility
of doubt “that English, together with all the Teutonic dialects of the Continent,
belongs to that large family of speech which comprises, besides the Teutonic, Latin,
Greek, Slavonic, and Celtic, the Oriental languages of India and Persia.” “It has
also been proved that the various tribes who started from the central home to discover
Europe in the north, and India in the south, carried away with them, not only a common
language, but a common faith and a common mythology. These are facts which may be
ignored but cannot be disputed, and the two sciences of comparative grammar and comparative
mythology, though but of recent origin, rest on a foundation as sound and safe as
that of any of the inductive sciences.” “For more than a thousand years the Scandinavian
inhabitants of Norway have been separated in language from their Teutonic brethren
on the Continent, and yet both have not only preserved the same stock of popular stories,
but they tell them, in several instances, in almost the same words.”
</p>
<p>This resemblance, so strong in the early literature of nations inhabiting countries
which present much the same physical aspect and have nearly the same climate, is not
so marked when we compare the Northern myths with those of the genial South. Still,
notwithstanding the contrast between Northern and Southern Europe, where these myths
gradually ripened and attained their full growth, there is an analogy between the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>two mythologies which shows that the seeds from whence both sprang were originally
the same.
</p>
<p>In the foregoing chapters the Northern system of mythology has been outlined as clearly
as possible, and the physical significance of the myths has been explained. Now we
shall endeavour to set forth the resemblance of Northern mythology to that of the
other Aryan nations, by comparing it with the Greek, which, however, it does not resemble
as closely as it does the Oriental.
</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible in a work of this character to do more than mention the
main points of resemblance in the stories forming the basis of these religions; but
that will be sufficient to demonstrate, even to the most sceptical, that they must
have been identical at a period too remote to indicate now with any certainty.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Northern nations, like the Greeks, imagined that the world rose out of chaos;
and while the latter described it as a vapoury, formless mass, the former, influenced
by their immediate surroundings, depicted it as a chaos of fire and ice—a combination
which is only too comprehensible to any one who has visited Iceland and seen the wild,
peculiar contrast between its volcanic soil, spouting geysers, and the great icebergs
which hedge it round during the long, dark winter season.
</p>
<p>From these opposing elements, fire and ice, were born the first divinities, who, like
the first gods of the Greeks, were gigantic in stature and uncouth in appearance.
Ymir, the huge ice giant, and his descendants, are comparable to the Titans, who were
also elemental forces of Nature, personifications of subterranean fire; and both,
having held full sway for a time, were obliged to yield to greater perfection. After
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>fierce struggle for supremacy, they all found themselves defeated and banished to
the respective remote regions of Tartarus and Jötun-heim.

<p>The triad, Odin, Vili, and Ve, of the Northern myth is the exact counterpart of Jupiter,
Neptune, and Pluto, who, superior to the Titan forces, rule supreme over the world
in their turn. In the Greek mythology, the gods, who are also all related to one another,
betake themselves to Olympus, where they build golden palaces for their use; and in
the Northern mythology the divine conquerors repair to Asgard, and there construct
similar dwellings.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Northern cosmogony was not unlike the Greek, for the people imagined that the earth,
Mana-heim, was entirely surrounded by the sea, at the bottom of which lay coiled the
huge Midgard snake, biting its own tail; and it was perfectly natural that, viewing
the storm-lashed waves which beat against their shores, they should imagine these
to be caused by his convulsive writhing. The Greeks, who also fancied the earth was
round and compassed by a mighty river called Oceanus, described it as flowing with
“a steady, equable current,” for they generally gazed out upon calm and sunlit seas.
Nifl-heim, the Northern region of perpetual cold and mist, had its exact counterpart
in the land north of the Hyperboreans, where feathers (snow) continually hovered in
the air, and where Hercules drove the Ceryneian stag into a snowdrift ere he could
seize and bind it fast.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like the Greeks, the Northern races believed that the earth was created first, and
that the vaulted heavens were made afterwards to overshadow it entirely. They <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>also imagined that the sun and moon were daily driven across the sky in chariots drawn
by fiery steeds. Sol, the sun maiden, therefore corresponded to Helios, Hyperion,
Phœbus, or Apollo, while Mani, the Moon (owing to a peculiarity of Northern grammar,
which makes the sun feminine and the moon masculine), was the exact counterpart of
Phœbe, Diana, or Cynthia.
</p>
<p>The Northern scalds, who thought that they descried the prancing forms of white-maned
steeds in the flying clouds, and the glitter of spears in the flashing light of the
aurora borealis, said that the Valkyrs, or battle maidens, galloped across the sky,
while the Greeks saw in the same natural phenomena the white flocks of Apollo guarded
by Phaetusa and Lampetia.
</p>
<p>As the dew fell from the clouds, the Northern poets declared that it dropped from
the manes of the Valkyrs’ steeds, while the Greeks, who observed that it generally
sparkled longest in the thickets, identified it with Daphne and Procris, whose names
are derived from the Sanskrit word which means “to sprinkle,” and who are slain by
their lovers, Apollo and Cephalus, personifications of the sun.
</p>
<p>The earth was considered in the North as well as in the South as a female divinity,
the fostering mother of all things; and it was owing to climatic difference only that
the mythology of the North, where people were daily obliged to conquer the right to
live by a hand-to-hand struggle with Nature, should represent her as hard and frozen
like Rinda, while the Greeks embodied her in the genial goddess Ceres. The Greeks
believed that the cold winter winds swept down from the North, and the Northern races,
in addition, added that they were produced by the winnowing of the wings of the great
eagle Hræ-svelgr.
</p>
<p>The dwarfs, or dark elves, bred in Ymir’s flesh, were <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>like Pluto’s servants in that they never left their underground realm, where they,
too, sought the precious metals, which they moulded into delicate ornaments such as
Vulcan bestowed upon the gods, and into weapons which no one could either dint or
mar. As for the light elves, who lived above ground and cared for plants, trees, and
streams, they were evidently the Northern equivalents to the nymphs, dryads, oreades,
and hamadryads, which peopled the woods, valleys, and fountains of ancient Greece.

<h3 class="main">Jupiter and Odin</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jupiter, like Odin, was the father of the gods, the god of victory, and a personification
of the universe. Hlidskialf, Allfather’s lofty throne, was no less exalted than Olympus
or Ida, whence the Thunderer could observe all that was taking place; and Odin’s invincible
spear Gungnir was as terror-inspiring as the thunderbolts brandished by his Greek
prototype. The Northern deities feasted continually upon mead and boar’s flesh, the
drink and meat most suitable to the inhabitants of a Northern climate, while the gods
of Olympus preferred the nectar and ambrosia which formed their only sustenance.
</p>
<p>Twelve Æsir sat in Odin’s council hall to deliberate over the wisest measures for
the government of the world and men, and an equal number of gods assembled on the
cloudy peak of Mount Olympus for a similar purpose. The Golden Age in Greece was a
period of idyllic happiness, amid ever-flowering groves and under balmy skies, while
the Northern age of bliss was also a time when peace and innocence flourished on the
earth, and when evil was as yet entirely unknown.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Using the materials near at hand, the Greeks modelled their first images out of clay;
hence they naturally imagined that Prometheus had made man out of that substance when
called upon to fashion a creature inferior to the gods only. As the Northern statues
were hewn out of wood, the Northern races inferred, as a matter of course, that Odin,
Vili, and Ve (who here correspond to Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Minerva, the three
Greek creators of man) made the first human couple, Ask and Embla, out of blocks of
wood.
</p>
<p>The goat Heidrun, which supplied the heavenly mead, is like Amalthea, Jupiter’s first
nurse, and the busy, tell-tale Ratatosk is equivalent to the snow-white crow in the
story of Coronis, which was turned black in punishment for its tattling. Jupiter’s
eagle has its counterpart in the ravens Hugin and Munin, or in the wolves Geri and
Freki, which are ever crouching at Odin’s feet.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The close resemblance between the Northern Orlog and the Greek Destiny, goddesses
whose decrees the gods themselves were obliged to respect, and the equally powerful
Norns and Mœræ, is too obvious to need pointing out, while the Vanas are counterparts
of Neptune and the other ocean divinities. The great quarrel between the Vanas and
the Æsir is merely another version of the dispute between Jupiter and Neptune for
the supremacy of the world. Just as Jupiter forces his brother to yield to his authority,
so the Æsir remain masters of all, but do not refuse to continue to share their power
with their conquered foes, who thus become their allies and friends.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like Jupiter, Odin is always described as majestic and middle-aged, and both gods
are regarded as the divine progenitors of royal races, for while the Heraclidæ claimed
Jupiter as their father, the Inglings, Skioldings, etc., held that Odin was the founder
of their families. The most solemn oaths were sworn by Odin’s spear as well as by
Jupiter’s footstool, and both gods rejoice in a multitude of names, all descriptive
of the various phases of their nature and worship.
</p>
<p>Odin, like Jupiter, frequently visited the earth in disguise, to judge of the hospitable
intentions of mankind, as in the story of Geirrod and Agnar, which resembles that
of Philemon and Baucis. The aim was to encourage hospitality; therefore, in both stories,
those who showed themselves humanely inclined are richly rewarded, and in the Northern
myth the lesson is enforced by the punishment inflicted upon Geirrod, as the scalds
believed in poetic justice and saw that it was carefully meted out.
</p>
<p>The contest of wit between Odin and Vafthrudnir has its parallel in the musical rivalry
of Apollo and Marsyas, or in the test of skill between Minerva and Arachne. Odin further
resembled Apollo in that he, too, was god of eloquence and poetry, and could win all
hearts by means of his divine voice; he was like Mercury in that he taught mortals
the use of runes, while the Greek god introduced the alphabet.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The disappearance of Odin, the sun or summer, and the consequent desolation of Frigga,
the earth, is merely a different version of the myths of Proserpine and Adonis. When
Proserpine and Adonis have gone, the earth (Ceres or Venus) bitterly mourns their
absence, and refuses all consolation. It is only when <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>they return from their exile that she casts off her mourning garments and gloom, and
again decks herself in all her jewels. So Frigga and Freya bewail the absence of their
husbands Odin and Odur, and remain hard and cold until their return. Odin’s wife,
Saga, the goddess of history, who lingered by Sokvabek, “the stream of time and events,”
taking note of all she saw, is like Clio, the muse of history, whom Apollo sought
by the inspiring fount of Helicon.
</p>
<p>Just as, according to Euhemerus, there was an historical Zeus, buried in Crete, where
his grave can still be seen, so there was an historical Odin, whose mound rises near
Upsala, where the greatest Northern temple once stood, and where there was a mighty
oak which rivalled the famous tree of Dodona.

<h3 class="main">Frigga and Juno</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Frigga, like Juno, was a personification of the atmosphere, the patroness of marriage,
of connubial and motherly love, and the goddess of childbirth. She, too, is represented
as a beautiful, stately woman, rejoicing in her adornments; and her special attendant,
Gna, rivals Iris in the rapidity with which she executes her mistress’s behests. Juno
has full control over the clouds, which she can brush away with a motion of her hand,
and Frigga is supposed to weave them out of the thread she has spun on her jewelled
spinning wheel.
</p>
<p>In Greek mythology we find many examples of the way in which Juno seeks to outwit
Jupiter. Similar tales are not lacking in the Northern myths. Juno obtains possession
of Io, in spite of her husband’s reluctance to part with her, and Frigga artfully
secures the victory for the Winilers in the Langobarden Saga. Odin’s wrath at Frigga’s
theft of the gold from his <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>statue is equivalent to Jupiter’s marital displeasure at Juno’s jealousy and interference
during the war of Troy. In the story of Gefjon, and the clever way in which she procured
land from Gylfi to form her kingdom of Seeland, we have a reproduction of the story
of Dido, who obtained by stratagem the land upon which she founded her city of Carthage.
In both accounts oxen come into play, for while in the Northern myth these sturdy
beasts draw the piece of land far out to sea, in the other an ox hide, cut into strips,
serves to enclose the queen’s grant.

dead, is the counterpart of Mercury Psychopompus, both being personifications of the
wind, on whose wings disembodied souls were thought to be wafted from this mortal
sphere.
</p>
<p>The trusty Eckhardt, who would fain save Tannhäuser and prevent his returning to expose
himself to the enchantments of the sorceress, in the Hörselberg, is like the Greek
Mentor, who not only accompanied Telemachus, but gave him good advice and wise instructions,
and would have rescued Ulysses from the hands of Calypso.

<h3 class="main">Thor and the Greek Gods</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thor, the Northern thunder-god, also has many points of resemblance with Jupiter.
He bears the hammer Miölnir, the Northern emblem of the deadly thunderbolt, and, like
Jupiter, uses it freely when warring against the giants. In his rapid growth Thor
resembles Mercury, for while the former playfully <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>tosses about several loads of ox hides a few hours after his birth, the latter steals
Apollo’s oxen before he is one day old. In physical strength Thor resembles Hercules,
who also gave early proofs of uncommon vigour by strangling the serpents sent to slay
him in his cradle, and who delighted, later on, in attacking and conquering giants
and monsters. Hercules became a woman and took to spinning to please Omphale, the
Lydian queen, and Thor assumed a woman’s apparel to visit Thrym and recover his hammer,
which had been buried nine rasts underground. The hammer, his principal attribute,
was used for many sacred purposes. It consecrated the funeral pyre and the marriage
rite, and boundary stakes driven in by a hammer were considered as sacred among Northern
nations as the Hermæ or statues of Mercury, removal of which was punishable by death.
</p>
<p>Thor’s wife, Sif, with her luxuriant golden hair, is, as we have already stated, an
emblem of the earth, and her hair of its rich vegetation. Loki’s theft of these tresses
is equivalent to Pluto’s rape of Proserpine. To recover the golden locks, Loki must
visit the dwarfs (Pluto’s servants), crouching in the low passages of the underground
world; so Mercury must seek Proserpine in Hades.
</p>
<p>The gadfly which hinders Jupiter from recovering possession of Io, after Mercury has
slain Argus, reappears in the Northern myth to sting Brock and to endeavour to prevent
the manufacture of the magic ring Draupnir, which is merely a counterpart of Sif’s
tresses, as it also represents the fruits of the earth. The fly continues to torment
the dwarf during the manufacture of Frey’s golden-bristled boar, a prototype of Apollo’s
golden sun chariot, and it prevents the perfect formation of the handle of Thor’s
hammer.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>The magic ship Skidbladnir, also made by the dwarfs, is like the swift-sailing Argo,
which was a personification of the clouds sailing overhead; and just as the former
was said to be large enough to accommodate all the gods, so the latter bore all the
Greek heroes off to the distant land of Colchis.
</p>
<p>The Germans, wishing to name the days of the week after their gods, as the Romans
had done, gave the name of Thor to Jove’s day, and thus made it the present Thursday.
</p>
<p>Thor’s struggle against Hrungnir is a parallel to the fight between Hercules and Cacus
or Antæus; while Groa is evidently Ceres, for she, too, mourns for her absent child
Orvandil (Proserpine), and breaks out into a song of joy when she hears that it will
return.
</p>
<p>Magni, Thor’s son, who when only three hours old exhibits his marvellous strength
by lifting Hrungnir’s leg off his recumbent father, also reminds us of the infant
Hercules; and Thor’s voracious appetite at Thrym’s wedding feast has its parallel
in Mercury’s first meal, which consisted of two whole oxen.
</p>
<p>The crossing of the swollen tide of Veimer by Thor reminds us of Jason’s feat when
he waded across the torrent on his way to visit the tyrant Pelias and recover possession
of his father’s throne.
</p>
<p>The marvellous necklace worn by Frigga and Freya to enhance their charms is like the
cestus or girdle of Venus, which Juno borrowed to subjugate her lord, and is, like
Sif’s tresses and the ring Draupnir, an emblem of luxuriant vegetation or a type of
the stars which shine in the firmament.
</p>
<p>The Northern sword-god Tyr is, of course, the Greek war-god Ares, whom he so closely
resembles that his name was given to the day of the week held sacred to Ares, which
is even now known as Tuesday or Tiu’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>day. Like Ares, Tyr was noisy and courageous; he delighted in the din of battle, and
was fearless at all times. He alone dared to brave the Fenris wolf; and the Southern
proverb concerning Scylla and Charybdis has its counterpart in the Northern adage,
“to get loose out of Læding and to dash out of Droma.” The Fenris wolf, also a personification
of subterranean fire, is bound, like his prototypes the Titans, in Tartarus.
</p>
<p>The similarity between the gentle, music-loving Bragi, with his harp, and Apollo or
Orpheus, is very great; so is the resemblance between the magic draught Od-hroerir
and the waters of Helicon, both of which were supposed to serve as inspiration to
mortal as well as to immortal poets. Odin dons eagle plumes to bear away this precious
mead, and Jupiter assumes a similar guise to secure his cupbearer Ganymede.
</p>
<p>Idun, like Adonis and Proserpine, or still more like Eurydice, is also a fair personification
of spring. She is borne away by the cruel ice giant Thiassi, who represents the boar
which slew Adonis, the kidnapper of Proserpine, or the poisonous serpent which bit
Eurydice. Idun is detained for a long time in Jötun-heim (Hades), where she forgets
all her merry, playful ways, and becomes mournful and pale. She cannot return alone
to Asgard, and it is only when Loki (now an emblem of the south wind) comes to bear
her away in the shape of a nut or a swallow that she can effect her escape. She reminds
us of Proserpine and Adonis escorted back to earth by Mercury (god of the wind), or
of Eurydice lured out of Hades by the sweet sounds of Orpheus’s harp, which were also
symbolical of the soughing of the winds.

tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, for the former, like Bragi, cannot exist without the
latter, whom he follows even into the dark realm of death; without her his songs are
entirely silenced. The wolf-skin in which Idun is enveloped is typical of the heavy
snows in Northern regions, which preserve the tender roots from the blighting influence
of the extreme winter cold.

<p class="first">The Van Niörd, who is god of the sunny summer seas, has his counterpart in Neptune
and more especially in Nereus, the personification of the calm and pleasant aspect
of the mighty deep. Niörd’s wife, Skadi, is the Northern huntress; she therefore resembles
Diana. Like her, she bears a quiver full of arrows, and a bow which she handles with
consummate skill. Her short gown permits the utmost freedom of motion, also, and she,
too, is generally accompanied by a hound.
</p>
<p>The story of the transference of Thiassi’s eyes to the firmament, where they glow
like brilliant stars, reminds us of many Greek star myths, and especially of Argus’s
eyes ever on the watch, of Orion and his jewelled girdle, and of his dog Sirius, all
changed into stars by the gods to appease angry goddesses. Loki’s antics to win a
smile from the irate Skadi are considered akin to the quivering flashes of sheet-lightning
which he personified in the North, while Steropes, the Cyclops, typified it for the
Greeks.

<p class="first">The Northern god of sunshine and summer showers, the genial Frey, has many traits

boar which was the Northern conception <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>of the sunbeams, or drives across the sky in a golden car, which reminds us of Apollo’s
glittering chariot.
</p>
<p>Frey has some of the gentle Zephyrus’s characteristics besides, for he, too, scatters
flowers along his way. His horse Blodug-hofi is not unlike Pegasus, Apollo’s favourite
steed, for it can pass through fire and water with equal ease and velocity.
</p>
<p>Fro, like Odin and Jupiter, is also identified with a human king, and his mound lies
beside Odin’s near Upsala. His reign was so happy that it was called the Golden Age,
and he therefore reminds us of Saturn, who, exiled to earth, ruled over the people
of Italy, and granted them similar prosperity.

woo and hard to win, like the fleet-footed maiden, but, like her, she yields at last
and becomes a happy wife. The golden apples with which Skirnir tries to bribe her
remind us of the golden fruit which Hippomenes cast in Atalanta’s way, and which made
her lose the race.
</p>
<p>Freya, the goddess of youth, love, and beauty, like Venus, sprang from the sea, for
she is a daughter of the sea-god Niörd. Venus bestowed her best affections upon the
god of war and upon the martial Anchises, while Freya often assumes the garb of a
Valkyr, and rides rapidly to earth to take part in mortal strife and bear away the
heroic slain to feast in her halls. Like Venus, she delights in offerings of fruits
and flowers, and lends a gracious ear to the petitions of lovers. Freya also resembles
Minerva, for, like her, she wears a helmet and breastplate, and, like her, also, she
is noted for her beautiful blue eyes.

<p class="first">Odur, Freya’s husband, is like Adonis, and when he leaves her, she, too, sheds countless
tears, which, in her case, are turned to gold, while Venus’s tears are changed into
anemones, and those of the Heliades, mourning for Phaeton, harden to amber, which
resembles gold in colour and in consistency. Just as Venus rejoices at Adonis’s return,
and all Nature blooms in sympathy with her joy, so Freya becomes lighthearted once
more when she has found her husband beneath the flowering myrtles of the South. Venus’s
car is drawn by fluttering doves, and Freya’s is swiftly carried along by cats, which
are emblems of sensual love, as the doves were considered types of tenderest love.
Freya is appreciative of beauty and angrily refuses to marry Thrym, while Venus scorns
and finally deserts Vulcan, whom she has been forced to marry against her will.
</p>
<p>The Greeks represented Justice as a goddess blindfolded, with scales in one hand and
a sword in the other, to indicate the impartiality and the fixity of her decrees.
The corresponding deity of the North was Forseti, who patiently listened to both sides
of a question ere he, too, promulgated his impartial and irrevocable sentence.
</p>
<p>Uller, the winter-god, resembles Apollo and Orion only in his love for the chase,
which he pursues with ardour under all circumstances. He is the Northern bowman, and
his skill is quite as unerring as theirs.
</p>
<p>Heimdall, like Argus, was gifted with marvellous keenness of sight, which enabled
him to see a hundred miles off as plainly by night as by day. His Giallar-horn, which
could be heard throughout all the world, proclaiming the gods’ passage to and fro
over the quivering bridge Bifröst, was like the trumpet of the goddess Renown. As
he was related to the water <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>deities on his mother’s side, he could, like Proteus, assume any form at will, and
he made good use of this power on the occasion when he frustrated Loki’s attempt to
steal the necklace Brisinga-men.
</p>
<p>Hermod, the quick or nimble, resembles Mercury not only in his marvellous celerity
of motion. He, too, was the messenger of the gods, and, like the Greek divinity, flashed
hither and thither, aided not by winged cap and sandals, but by Odin’s steed Sleipnir,
whom he alone was allowed to bestride. Instead of the Caduceus, he bore the wand Gambantein.
He questioned the Norns and the magician Rossthiof, through whom he learned that Vali
would come to avenge his brother Balder and to supplant his father Odin. Instances
of similar consultations are found in Greek mythology, where Jupiter would fain have
married Thetis, yet desisted when the Fates foretold that if he did so she would be
the mother of a son who would surpass his father in glory and renown.
</p>
<p>The Northern god of silence, Vidar, has some resemblance to Hercules, for while the
latter has nothing but a club with which to defend himself against the Nemean lion,
whom he tears asunder, the former is enabled to rend the Fenris wolf at Ragnarok by
the possession of one large shoe.

the fertilising sunbeams, the footbath in the Northern story typifies the spring thaw
which sets in when the sun has overcome the resistance of the frozen earth. Perseus,
the child of this union, has many points of resemblance with Vali, for he, too, <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>is an avenger, and slays his mother’s enemies just as surely as Vali destroys Hodur,
the murderer of Balder.

<p>The Fates were supposed to preside over birth in Greece, and to foretell a child’s
future, as did the Norns; and the story of Meleager has its unmistakable parallel
in that of Nornagesta. Althæa preserves the half-consumed brand in a chest, Nornagesta
conceals the candle-end in his harp; and while the Greek mother brings about her son’s
death by casting the brand into the fire, Nornagesta, compelled to light his candle-end
at Olaf’s command, dies as it sputters and burns out.
</p>
<p>Hebe and the Valkyrs were the cupbearers of Olympus and Asgard. They were all personifications
of youth; and while Hebe married the great hero and demigod Hercules when she ceased
to fulfil her office, the Valkyrs were relieved from their duties when united to heroes
like Helgi, Hakon, Völund, or Sigurd.
</p>
<p>The Cretan labyrinth has its counterpart in the Icelandic Völundarhaus, and Völund
and Dædalus both effect their escape from a maze by a cleverly devised pair of wings,
which enable them to fly in safety over land and sea and escape from the tyranny of
their respective masters, Nidud and Minos. Völund resembles Vulcan, also, in that
he is a clever smith and makes use of his talents to work out his revenge. Vulcan,
lamed by a fall from Olympus, and neglected by Juno, whom he had tried to befriend,
sends her a golden throne, which is provided with cunning springs to seize and hold
her fast. Völund, hamstrung by the suggestion of Nidud’s queen, secretly murders her
sons, and out of their eyes fashions marvellous jewels, which she unsuspectingly wears
upon her breast until he reveals their origin.

<p class="first">Just as the Greeks fancied that the tempests were the effect of Neptune’s wrath, so
the Northern races attributed them either to the writhings of Iörmungandr, the Midgard
snake, or to the anger of Ægir, who, crowned with seaweed like Neptune, often sent
his children, the wave maidens (the counterpart of the Nereides and Oceanides), to
play on the tossing billows. Neptune had his dwelling in the coral caves near the
Island of Eubœa, while Ægir lived in a similar palace near the Cattegat. Here he was
surrounded by the nixies, undines, and mermaids, the counterpart of the Greek water
nymphs, and by the river-gods of the Rhine, Elbe, and Neckar, who remind us of Alpheus
and Peneus, the river-gods of the Greeks.
</p>
<p>The frequency of shipwrecks on the Northern coasts made the people think of Ran (the
equivalent of the Greek sea-goddess Amphitrite) as greedy and avaricious, and they
described her as armed with a strong net, with which she drew all things down into
the deep. The Greek Sirens had their parallel in the Northern Lorelei, who possessed
the same gift of song, and also lured mariners to their death; while Princess Ilse,
who was turned into a fountain, reminds us of the nymph Arethusa, who underwent a
similar transformation.
</p>
<p>In the Northern conception of Nifl-heim we have an almost exact counterpart of the
Greek Hades. Mödgud, the guardian of the Giallar-bridge (the bridge of death), over
which all the spirits of the dead must pass, exacts a tribute of blood as rigorously
as Charon demands an obolus from every soul he ferries over Acheron, the river of
death. The fierce dog Garm, cowering in the Gnipa hole, and keeping guard at Hel’s
gate, is like <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>the three-headed monster Cerberus; and the nine worlds of Nifl-heim are not unlike
the divisions of Hades, Nastrond being an adequate substitute for Tartarus, where
the wicked were punished with equal severity.
</p>
<p>The custom of burning dead heroes with their arms, and of slaying victims, such as
horses and dogs, upon their pyre, was much the same in the North as in the South;
and while Mors or Thanatos, the Greek Death, was represented with a sharp scythe,
Hel was depicted with a broom or rake, which she used as ruthlessly, and with which
she did as much execution.

<h3 class="main">Balder and Apollo</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Balder, the radiant god of sunshine, reminds us not only of Apollo and Orpheus, but
of all the other heroes of sun myths. His wife Nanna is like Flora, and still more
like Proserpine, for she, too, goes down into the underworld, where she tarries for
a while. Balder’s golden hall of Breidablik is like Apollo’s palace in the east; he,
also, delights in flowers; all things smile at his approach, and willingly pledge
themselves not to injure him. As Achilles was vulnerable only in the heel, so Balder
could be slain only by the harmless mistletoe, and his death is occasioned by Loki’s
jealousy just as Hercules was slain by that of Deianeira. Balder’s funeral pyre on
Ringhorn reminds us of Hercules’s death on Mount Œta, the flames and reddish glow
of both fires serving to typify the setting sun. The Northern god of sun and summer
could only be released from Nifl-heim if all animate and inanimate objects shed tears;
so Proserpine could issue from Hades only upon condition that she had partaken of
no food. The trifling refusal of Thok to shed a single tear is like the pomegranate
seeds which Proserpine ate, and the result <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>is equally disastrous in both cases, as it detains Balder and Proserpine underground,
and the earth (Frigga or Ceres) must continue to mourn their absence.
</p>
<p>Through Loki evil entered into the Northern world; Prometheus’s gift of fire brought
the same curse upon the Greeks. The punishment inflicted by the gods upon the culprits
is not unlike, for while Loki is bound with adamantine chains underground, and tortured
by the continuous dropping of venom from the fangs of a snake fastened above his head,
Prometheus is similarly fettered to Caucasus, and a ravenous vulture continually preys
upon his liver. Loki’s punishment has another counterpart in that of Tityus, bound
in Hades, and in that of Enceladus, chained beneath Mount Ætna, where his writhing
produced earthquakes, and his imprecations caused sudden eruptions of the volcano.
Loki, further, resembles Neptune in that he, too, assumed an equine form and was the
parent of a wonderful steed, for Sleipnir rivals Arion both in speed and endurance.
</p>
<p>The Fimbul-winter has been compared to the long preliminary fight under the walls
of Troy, and Ragnarok, the grand closing drama of Northern mythology, to the burning
of that famous city. “Thor is Hector; the Fenris wolf, Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, who
slew Priam (Odin); and Vidar, who survives in Ragnarok, is Æneas.” The destruction
of Priam’s palace is the type of the ruin of the gods’ golden halls; and the devouring
wolves Hati, Sköll, and Managarm, the fiends of darkness, are prototypes of Paris
and all the other demons of darkness, who bear away or devour the sun-maiden Helen.

<p class="first">According to another interpretation, however, Ragnarok and the consequent submersion
of the world is <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>but a Northern version of the Deluge. The survivors, Lif and Lifthrasir, like Deucalion
and Pyrrha, were destined to repeople the world; and just as the shrine of Delphi
alone resisted the destructive power of the great cataclysm, so Gimli stood radiant
to receive the surviving gods.

<h3 class="main">Giants and Titans</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already seen how closely the Northern giants resembled the Titans. It only
remains to mention that while the Greeks imagined that Atlas was changed into a mountain,
so the Northmen believed that the Riesengebirge, in Germany, were formed from giants,
and that the avalanches which descended from their lofty heights were the burdens
of snow which these giants impatiently shook from their crests as they changed their
cramped positions. The apparition, in the shape of a bull, of one of the water giants,
who came to woo the queen of the Franks, has its parallel in the story of Jupiter’s
wooing of Europa, and Meroveus is evidently the exact counterpart of Sarpedon. A faint
resemblance can be traced between the giant ship Mannigfual and the Argo, for while
the one is supposed to have cruised through the Ægean and Euxine Seas, and to have
made many places memorable by the dangers it encountered there, so the Northern vessel
sailed about the North and Baltic Seas, and is mentioned in connection with the Island
of Bornholm and the cliffs of Dover.
</p>
<p>While the Greeks imagined that Nightmares were the evil dreams which escaped from
the Cave of Somnus, the Northern race fancied they were female dwarfs or trolls, who
crept out of the dark recesses of the earth to torment them. All magic weapons in
the North were said to be the work of the dwarfs, the underground smiths, while those
of the Greeks were <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>manufactured by Vulcan and the Cyclopes, under Mount Ætna, or on the Island of Lemnos.

<h3 class="main">The Volsunga Saga</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Sigurd myth we find Odin one-eyed like the Cyclopes, who, like him, are personifications
of the sun. Sigurd is instructed by Gripir, the horse-trainer, who is reminiscent
of Chiron, the centaur. He is not only able to teach a young hero all he need know,
and to give him good advice concerning his future conduct, but is also possessed of
the gift of prophecy.
</p>
<p>The marvellous sword which becomes the property of Sigmund and of Sigurd as soon as
they prove themselves worthy to wield it, and the sword Angurvadel which Frithiof
inherits from his sire, remind us of the weapon which Ægeus concealed beneath the
rock, and which Theseus secured as soon as he had become a man. Sigurd, like Theseus,
Perseus, and Jason, seeks to avenge his father’s wrongs ere he sets out in search
of the golden hoard, the exact counterpart of the golden fleece, which is also guarded
by a dragon, and is very hard to secure. Like all the Greek sun-gods and heroes, Sigurd
has golden hair and bright blue eyes. His struggle with Fafnir reminds us of Apollo’s
fight with Python, while the ring Andvaranaut can be likened to Venus’s cestus, and
the curse attached to its possessor is like the tragedy of Helen, who brought endless
bloodshed upon all connected with her.
</p>
<p>Sigurd could not have conquered Fafnir without the magic sword, just as the Greeks
failed to take Troy without the arrows of Philoctetes, which are also emblems of the
all-conquering rays of the sun. The recovery of the stolen treasure is like Menelaus’s
recovery of Helen, and it apparently brings as little happiness to Sigurd as his recreant
wife did to the Spartan king.

<h3 class="main">Brunhild</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Brunhild resembles Minerva in her martial tastes, physical appearance, and wisdom;
but her anger and resentment when Sigurd forgets her for Gudrun is like the wrath
of Œnone, whom Paris deserts to woo Helen. Brunhild’s anger continues to accompany
Sigurd through life, and she even seeks to compass his death, while Œnone, called
to cure her wounded lover, refuses to do so and permits him to die. Œnone and Brunhild
are both overcome by the same remorseful feelings when their lovers have breathed
their last, and both insist upon sharing their funeral pyres, and end their lives
by the side of those whom they had loved.

<h3 class="main">Sun Myths</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Containing, as it does, a whole series of sun myths, the Volsunga Saga repeats itself
in every phase; and just as Ariadne, forsaken by the sun-hero Theseus, finally marries
Bacchus, so Gudrun, when Sigurd has departed, marries Atli, the King of the Huns.
He, too, ends his life amid the flames of his burning palace or ship. Gunnar, like
Orpheus or Amphion, plays such marvellous strains upon his harp that even the serpents
are lulled to sleep. According to some interpretations, Atli is like Fafnir, and covets
the possession of the gold. Both are therefore probably personifications “of the winter
cloud which broods over and keeps from mortals the gold of the sun’s light and heat,
till in the spring the bright orb overcomes the powers of darkness and tempests, and
scatters his gold over the face of the earth.”
</p>
<p>Swanhild, Sigurd’s daughter, is another personification of the sun, as is seen in
her blue eyes and golden hair; and her death under the hoofs of black steeds <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>represents the blotting out of the sun by clouds of storm or of darkness.
</p>
<p>Just as Castor and Pollux hasten to rescue their sister Helen when she has been borne
away by Theseus, so Swanhild’s brothers, Erp, Hamdir, and Sörli, hasten off to avenge
her death.
</p>
<p>Such are the main points of resemblance between the mythologies of the North and South,
and the analogy goes far to prove that they were originally formed from the same materials,
the principal differences being due to the local colouring imparted unconsciously
by the different races.

<p><i>The Bookman</i> says:—
</p>
<blockquote>“This magnificently illustrated volume, for which Messrs. Harrap are to be warmly
thanked, is among the most successful of its kind. They are stories which Mr. Guerber
has told with grace and charm, and right feeling for the classic periods; they are
stories which we have grown to believe can never be told too often. The book is a
fitting presentment of such a subject.”</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p><i>The Nation</i> says:—
</p>
<blockquote>“The stories are well told, and the arrangement of the book is admirable. Indeed,
we know no other book in which the classical myths are treated with such a combination
of accurate scholarship, simplicity, and literary skill.”</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p><i>The Scotsman</i> says:—
</p>
<blockquote>“Mr. Guerber has woven the classic mythology into a coherent history, and told with
remarkable freshness of interest the familiar myths and traditions of Greek and Roman
literature. The volume is at once a fascinating story-book and a valuable book of
reference, and not its least attraction lies in the beautiful illustrations, all of
which are reproductions of famous pictures, ancient and modern.”</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p><i>The Educational News</i> says:—
</p>
<blockquote>“This is indeed a glorious book, causing your reviewer to spend more of his time on
its pages than he can well afford. We need to know more about the Myths of Greece
and Rome … here is the very book to illumine, and, by its very beauty, to imbue its
readers with an appreciation of that gospel of the beautiful which these ancient myths
inculcate.”</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p><i>The Aberdeen Free Press</i> says:—
</p>
<blockquote>“There are many books on mythology, but we do not know any quite like the present.
It gives in a convenient compass all that the ordinary student need know, and the
stories are carefully classified. Mr. Guerber has produced a book which is a delight
to mind and eye alike.”</blockquote><p>

<p>Myths &amp; Legends of the Middle Ages
</p>
<p>By <span class="sc">H.&nbsp;A. Guerber</span>
</p>
<p>With Sixty-four exquisite Full-page Illustrations from important works of great artists
</p>
<blockquote><i>Demy 8vo, 8⅝ × 5¾ inches, 416 pp. Letterpress. With Full Index</i></blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The object of this work is to familiarize students with the myths and legends which
form the principal subjects of mediæval literature, and whose influence is everywhere
apparent in the subsequent history of literature and art. Following the plan and treatment
of the author’s earlier volumes in this series, appropriate quotations from mediæval
and modern writings are given in connection with the various legends. These illustrate
the style of the poem in which they are embodied, or lend additional force to some
point in the story. The book includes notable illustrations and a chapter on the romance
literature of the period in the various countries of Europe.
